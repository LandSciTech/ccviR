<p>The NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index release
3.02   </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Definitions and Guidelines for Scoring Risk Factors - Section
B   </p>

<p> Response required for at least 3 factors.  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>B. Indirect Exposure to Climate Change  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p> 1) Exposure to Sea Level Rise  </p>

<p> NOTES: This factor comes into play only in
the case that all or a portion of the range within the assessment area may be
subject to the effects of a 0.5-1 m or greater sea level rise and the
consequent influence of storm surges and intrusion of salt water. Most climate
model scenarios predict at least a 0.5 m sea level rise. Because projected sea
level rise (0.5-2 m by 2100) is great compared to historical sea level changes,
the negative impact on habitats for most affected species is expected to be
high.
<p> TOOLS: To visualize potential sea level rise
in coastal areas of the U.S., see http://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/slr.  </p>

<p> Greatly
Increase Vulnerability: &gt;90% of range occurs in area subject to sea
level rise (on low-lying island(s) or in coastal zone).   </p>

<p> Increase
Vulnerability: 50-90% of range occurs in area subject to sea level rise (on
low-lying island(s) or in coastal zone).  </p>

<p> Somewhat
Increase Vulnerability: 10-49% of range occurs in area subject to
sea level rise (on low-lying island(s) or in coastal zone).  </p>

<p> Neutral: &lt;10%
of range occur in area subject to sea level rise (on low-lying island(s) or in
coastal zone). Includes inland areas not subject to sea level rise. Also,
species that occur in an intertidal habitat that is expected to increase in
extent with a rising sea level.  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p> 2) Distribution Relative to Barriers  </p>

<p> NOTES: This factor assesses the degree to
which natural (e.g., topographic, geographic, ecological) or anthropogenic
barriers limit a species' ability to shift its range in response to climate
change. Barriers are defined here as features or areas that completely or
almost completely prevent movement or dispersal of the species (currently and
for the foreseeable future). Species for which barriers would inhibit
distributional shifts with climate change-caused shifts in climate envelopes
likely are more vulnerable to climate change than are species whose movements
are not affected by barriers. Barriers must be identified for each species (but
often are the same for a group of closely related species). Natural and
anthropogenic barriers are defined for many species and taxonomic groups in
NatureServe's Element Occurrence Specifications (viewable in the Population/Occurrence
Delineation section of species accounts on Natureserve Explorer,
http://www.natureserve.org/explorer), but usually these readily can be
determined by considering a species' basic movement capacity and ecological
tolerances.  </p>

<p> The distinction between a
barrier and unsuitable habitat sometimes may be unclear; in these cases assume
the feature or area is unsuitable habitat (habitat through which the species
can disperse or move but that does not support reproduction or long-term
survival) and score the species here and/or in factor C1 as appropriate. Note
that caves are considered under factor C3: Restriction to Uncommon
Landscape/Geological Features, and not here where the focus is on barriers that
affect the wide array of nonsubterranean species.  </p>

<p> A) NATURAL BARRIERS: Examples
of features that may function as natural barriers for various species: upland
habitat (i.e., absence of aquatic stream, lake, or pond habitat) is a barrier
for fishes (but not for semiaquatic or amphibious species that may occupy the
same body of water); high mountain ranges (especially those that extend
west-east) are a barrier for many lowland plants and nonvolant lowland animals;
warm lowlands are a barrier for some alpine species such as American pika but
not for elk or American pipit; large expanses of water are barriers for pocket
gophers and many other small terrestrial animals (but not for many volant
species, or for plant species that are dispersed by wide-ranging birds, or for
species that readily swim between land areas if the distance is not too great);
a high waterfall is a barrier for fishes (but not for American dippers or
gartersnakes that occur along the same stream).  </p>

<p> B) ANTHROPOGENIC BARRIERS:
Examples of features that may function as anthropogenic barriers: large areas
of intensive urban or agricultural development are barriers for many animals
and plants; waters subject to chronic chemical pollution (e.g., acid mine
drainage) can be a barrier for fishes and other strictly aquatic species;
waters subject to thermal pollution (e.g., from power plants) may be a barrier
for some strictly aquatic species but not for others (note thermal alterations
associated with reservoirs often produce unsuitable habitat rather than impose
a barrier); dams without fish passage facilities and improperly installed
culverts can be barriers for fishes and certain other strictly aquatic species;
tortoise-proof fencing may be barrier for small reptiles and certain other
nonvolant animals (but not for most plants, large mammals, or large snakes).  </p>

<p> Note that no barriers exist
for most temperate-zone bird species that simply fly over or around potential
obstructions. Species restricted to habitats that are believed to persist
unchanged in spite of climate change are scored as Neutral (because in these
situations barriers do not contribute to vulnerability even if climate
changes). If a feature or area does not completely or almost completely prevent
dispersal or movement then it is categorized here as unsuitable or suitable
habitat, and the dispersal/movement of individuals across that feature or area
is assessed under factor C1 (Dispersal and Movements). In most cases,
unsuitable habitat is habitat through which propagules or individuals may move
but that does not support reproduction or long-term survival.  </p>

<p> The degree to which a barrier
may affect a species' ability to shift its range in response to climate change
depends in part on the distance of the barrier from the species' current
distribution. Barriers that are separated from a species' range by a long
distance of relatively flat topography can nevertheless affect range shifts
because in gentle terrain relatively small changes in climate can result in
large shifts in the location of a particular climate envelope. If a species
changed its range accordingly (to track a particular climate envelope), it
might encounter barriers that were far from its original range. In contrast, in
landscapes in which climatic conditions change rapidly over small horizontal
distances (e.g., mountainous areas, steep slopes, or other topographically
diverse landscapes) a species' distribution would have to shift a relatively
small distance in order to track a particular climate envelope, so the species
is less likely to encounter distant barriers.   </p>

<p> To count as a barrier for the
purposes of this factor, a feature can be up to 50 km from the species' current
range when measured across areas where climate changes gradually over latitude
or longitude (e.g., relatively flat terrain) and up to 10 km when measured
across areas where climate changes abruptly over latitude or longitude (e.g.,
mountainous or steep terrain). Use 25 km for species that occur in intermediate
topography, such as moderate hill country. These distances apply to both
terrestrial and aquatic species. These distances are derived from Loarie et al.
(2009, Nature 462:1052).  </p>

<p> The following categories and
criteria apply to both natural and anthropogenic barriers, but the two types of
barriers are scored separately. Note that it is illogical for natural and
anthropogenic barriers to both cause greatly increased vulnerability to climate
change for a single species (only one or the other can completely surround a
species' range). If both barriers occur, estimate the relative portions of the
circumference of the range blocked by each and then score accordingly.  </p>

<p> TOOLS: One useful data source for assessing
intensity of land use as a potential anthropogenic barrier in the 48 contiguous
United States is the published maps and downloadable GIS data for
Wildland-Urban Interface of the Silvis Lab (University of Wisconsin-Madison and
the USDA Forest Service North Central Research Station, http://silvis.forest.wisc.edu/maps/wui_main).
Other data sets, such as the Global Land Cover Facility (NASA;
http://glcfapp.glcf.umd.edu/data/) are also acceptable (and offer wider
coverage) but may require more advanced GIS capabilities. Readily available
online sources of satellite imagery also may be useful in assessing
anthropogenic or certain other barriers.  </p>

<p> Greatly Increase Vulnerability: Barriers
completely OR almost completely surround the current distribution such that the
species' range in the assessment area is unlikely to be able to shift
significantly with climate change, or the direction of climate change-caused
shift in the species' favorable climate envelope is fairly well understood and
barriers prevent a range shift in that direction. See Neutral for species in
habitats not vulnerable to climate change.  </p>

<p> Examples
for natural barriers: lowland terrestrial species completely surrounded by high
mountains (or bordered closely and completely on the north side by high
mountains); cool-water stream fishes for which barriers would completely
prevent access to other cool-water areas if the present occupied habitat became
too warm as a result of climate change; most nonvolant species that exist only
on the south side of a very large lake in an area where habitats are expected
to shift northward with foreseeable climate change.  </p>

<p> Examples
for anthropogenic barriers: species limited to small habitats within
intensively developed urban or agricultural landscapes through which the
species cannot pass, A specific example of this category is provided by the
quino checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha quino), a resident of northern
Baja California and southern California; warming climates are forcing this
butterfly northward, but urbanization in San Diego blocks its movement
(Parmesan 1996, Nature 382:765).  </p>

<p> Increase Vulnerability: Barriers
border the current distribution such that climate change-caused distributional
shifts in the assessment area are likely to be greatly but not completely or
almost completely impaired.  </p>

<p> Examples
for natural barriers: certain lowland plant or small mammal species whose
ranges are mostly (50-90%) bordered by high mountains or a large lake.  </p>

<p> Examples
for anthropogenic barriers: most streams inhabited by a fish species have dams
that would prevent access to suitable habitat if the present occupied habitat
became too warm as a result of climate change; intensive urbanization surrounds
75% of the range of a salamander species.  </p>

<p> Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Barriers
border the current distribution such that climate change-caused distributional
shifts in the assessment area are likely to be significantly but not greatly or
completely impaired.  </p>

<p> Examples
for natural barriers: certain lowland plant or small mammal species whose
ranges are partially but not mostly bordered by high mountains or a large lake.  </p>

<p> Examples
for anthropogenic barriers: 10-50% of the margin of a plant species' range is
bordered by intensive urban development; 25% of the streams occupied by a fish
species include dams that are likely to impede range shifts driven by climate
change.  </p>

<p> Neutral: Significant
barriers do not exist for this species, OR small barriers exist in the
assessment area but likely would not significantly impair distributional shifts
with climate change, OR substantial barriers exist but are not likely to
contribute significantly to a reduction or loss of the species' habitat or area
of occupancy with projected climate change in the assessment area.  </p>

<p> Examples
of species in this category: most birds (for which barriers do not exist);
terrestrial snakes in extensive plains or deserts that may have small barriers
that would not impede distributional shifts with climate change; small
alpine-subalpine mammal (e.g., ermine, snowshoe hare) in extensive mountainous
wilderness area lacking major rivers or lakes; fishes in large deep lakes or
large main-stem rivers that are basically invulnerable to projected climate
change and lack dams, waterfalls, and significant pollution; a plant whose
climate envelope is shifting northward and range is bordered on the west by a
barrier but for which no barriers exist to the north.  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p> 3) Predicted Impact of Land Use Changes Resulting from
Human Responses to Climate Change   </p>

<p> (e.g., plantations for carbon
offsets, new seawalls in response to sea level rise, and renewable energy
projects such as wind-farms, solar arrays, or biofuels production)   </p>

<p> NOTES: Strategies designed to mitigate or
adapt to climate change have the potential to affect very large areas of land,
and the species that depend on these areas, in both positive and negative ways.
This factor arguably should be considered in conservation status assessments,
but considering that for most species this factor has not yet been considered
in these assessments, we include it here. If the land use changes for
alternative energy projects have already been considered in the conservation
status assessment for the species, consider not scoring this factor, especially
if the vulnerability assessment results will be used to revise status ranks.  </p>

<p> This factor is NOT intended to
include habitat loss or destruction due to on-going human activities, as these
should already be reflected in existing conservation status ranks. Include only
new activities related directly to climate change mitigation here. There is
much uncertainty about the types of mitigation action that are likely to
threaten habitats and species. Remember that multiple categories can be checked
for each factor to capture uncertainty. As federal and state climate change
legislation is enacted, some of the mitigation directions (and associated
threats or benefits to species) will become clearer.    </p>

the western U.S. see http://www.nrdc.org/land/sitingrenewables/usersguide.asp.
A library of energy-related maps can be found at
http://www.nrel.gov/gis/mapsearch/.  </p>

<p> Increase
Vulnerability: The natural history/requirements of the species are known to
be incompatible with mitigation-related land use changes that are likely to
very likely to occur within its current and/or potential future range. This
includes (but is not limited to) the following:  </p>

<p>
- Species requiring open habitats within landscapes likely to be reforested or
afforested. If the species requires openings within forests that are
created/maintained by natural processes (e.g., fire), and if those processes
have a reasonable likelihood of continuing to operate within its range, a
lesser impact category may be appropriate.  </p>

<p>
- Bird and bat species whose migratory routes, foraging territory, or lekking
sites include existing and/or suitable wind farm sites and for which studies
indicate substantial negative impact (e.g., mortality from or avoidance of
turbines). If such studies indicate a relatively low impact from wind energy
development, a lesser impact category may be appropriate.  </p>

<p>
- Greater than 20% of the species' range within the assessment area occurs on
marginal agricultural land, such as CRP land or other open areas with suitable
soils for agriculture (&quot;prime farmland&quot;, etc.) that are not currently
in agricultural production OR &gt; 50% of the species' range within the
assessment area occurs on any non-urbanized land with suitable soils, where
there is a reasonable expectation that such land may be converted to biofuel
production.  </p>

<p>
- The species occurs in one or more river/stream reaches not yet developed for
hydropower, but with the potential to be so developed.  </p>

<p>
- Species of deserts or other permanently open, flat lands with potential for
placement of solar arrays.   </p>

<p>
- Species dependent on dynamic shoreline habitats (e.g., active dunes or salt
marshes) likely to be destroyed by human fortifications against rising sea
levels.  </p>

<p> Somewhat
Increase Vulnerability: The natural history/requirements of the
species are known to be incompatible with mitigation-related land use changes
that may possibly occur within its current and/or potential future range,
including any of the above (under Increase).  </p>

<p> Neutral: The
species is unlikely to be significantly affected by mitigation-related land use
changes that may occur within its current and/or potential future range,
including any of the above; OR it is unlikely that any mitigation-related land
use changes will occur within the species' current and/or potential future
range; OR it may benefit from mitigation-related land use changes.</div>"})

    <p>
        2) Predicted Sensitivity to Temperature and Moisture Changes
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor pertains to the breadth of temperature and precipitation
    conditions, at both broad and local scales, within which a species is known
    to be capable of reproducing, feeding, growing, or otherwise existing.
    Species with narrow environmental tolerances/requirements may be more
    vulnerable to habitat loss from climate change than are species that thrive
    under diverse conditions.
</p>
<p>
    a) Predicted sensitivity to changes in temperature, based on current/recent
    past temperature tolerance
</p>
<p>
    i) Historical thermal niche (exposure to past variations in temperature)
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor measures large-scale temperature variation that a
    species has experienced in recent historical times (i.e., the past 50
    years), as approximated by mean seasonal temperature variation (difference
    between highest mean monthly maximum temperature and lowest mean monthly
    minimum temperature) for occupied cells within the assessment area. It is a
    proxy for species' temperature tolerance at a broad scale. This factor may
    be evaluated by comparing the species range with the Annual Temperature
    Variation map 1951-2006 (see first image at bottom of this page) or
    calculated using GIS data downloaded from NatureServe
    (http://www.natureserve.org/ccvi). For aquatic species, follow the same
    procedure as for terrestrial species, since this factor measures broad
    regional patterns.
</p>
<p>
    Use the annual map for both resident and migratory species. Although
    migratory species are not physically present to experience temperature
    variations, they nonetheless are affected by these variations through
    effects on food supply and habitat availability.
</p>
<p>
    Greatly Increase Vulnerability: Considering the mean seasonal temperature
    variation for occupied cells, the species has experienced very small (&lt;
    37° F/20.8° C) temperature variation in the past 50 years. Includes cave
    obligates and species occurring in thermally stable groundwater habitats.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Considering the mean seasonal temperature variation
    for occupied cells, the species has experienced small (37 - 47° F/20.8 -
    26.3° C) temperature variation in the past 50 years. Includes facultative
    cave invertebrates.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Considering the mean seasonal temperature
    variation for occupied cells, the species has experienced slightly lower
    than average (47.1 - 57° F/26.3 - 31.8° C) temperature variation in the
    past 50 years.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Considering the mean seasonal temperature variation for occupied
    cells, the species has experienced average or greater than average
    (&gt;57.1° F/43.0° C) temperature variation in the past 50 years.
</p>
<p>
    ii) Physiological thermal niche
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: Current projections indicate that climate warming will be nearly
    pervasive in North America over the next several decades. Species
    associated with cool or cold conditions likely will experience a reduction
    in habitat extent or quality and may experience declines in distribution or
    abundance within a given assessment area. This factor assesses the degree
    to which a species is restricted to relatively cool or cold above-ground
    terrestrial or aquatic environments that are thought to be vulnerable to
    loss or significant reduction as a result of climate change. Species that
    depend on these cool/cold environments include (but may not be limited to)
    those that occur in the assessment area's highest elevational zones,
    northernmost areas, or the coldest waters. The restriction to these
    relatively cool environments may be permanent or seasonal.
</p>
<p>
    Species that occur in frost pockets, on north-facing slopes, in shady
    ravines, in alpine areas, or similar cool sites are scored here if those
    areas represent or are among the coldest environments in the assessment
    area; lacking this stipulation, species occurring in such sites may not be
    vulnerable to climate change because favorable sites may simply shift in
    location without reduction or loss. Species that are associated
    specifically with snow or ice are assessed separately in factor C2d. Note
    that temperature conditions and hydrological regimes often covary and often
    are not neatly separable; these situations should be scored here if
    temperature per se appears to be the overriding factor; otherwise they
    should be scored under factor C2bii: Physiological Hydrological Niche.
</p>
<p>
    Greatly Increase Vulnerability: Species is completely or almost completely
    (&gt; 90% of occurrences or range) restricted to relatively cool or cold
    environments that may be lost or reduced in the assessment area as a result
    of climate change.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Species is moderately (50-90% of occurrences or
    range) restricted to relatively cool or cold environments that may be lost
    or reduced in the assessment area as a result of climate change.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Species is somewhat (10-50% of occurrences
    or range) restricted to relatively cool or cold environments that may be
    lost or reduced in the assessment area as a result of climate change.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Species distribution is not significantly affected by thermal
    characteristics of the environment in the assessment area, species occupies
    habitats that are thought to be not vulnerable to projected climate change,
    or species shows a preference for environments at the warmer end of the
    spectrum.
</p>
<p>
    b) Predicted sensitivity to changes in precipitation, hydrology, or
    moisture regime.
</p>
<p>
    i) Historical hydrological niche (exposure to past variations in
    precipitation)
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor measures large-scale precipitation variation that a
    species has experienced in recent historical times (i.e., the past 50
    years), as approximated by mean annual precipitation variation across
    occupied cells within the assessment area. Overlay the species’ range on
    the Climate Wizard mean annual precipitation map 1951-2006. Subtract the
    lowest pixel value from the highest value to assess this factor. Use the
    extreme pixel values for this calculation. Use annual data for migratory
    species, as this measure reflects the precipitation regime of the ecosystem
    as a whole.
</p>
<p>
    Greatly Increase Vulnerability: Considering the range of mean annual
    precipitation across occupied cells, the species has experienced very small
    (&lt; 4 inches/100 mm) precipitation variation in the past 50 years.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Considering the range of mean annual precipitation
    across occupied cells, the species has experienced small (4 - 10 inches/100
    - 254 mm) precipitation variation in the past 50 years.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Considering the range of mean annual
    precipitation across occupied cells, the species has experienced slightly
    lower than average (11 - 20 inches/255 - 508 mm) precipitation variation in
    the past 50 years.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Considering the range of mean annual precipitation across occupied
    cells, the species has experienced average or greater than average &gt;20
    inches/508 mm) precipitation variation in the past 50 years.

    Definitions and Guidelines for Scoring Risk Factors - Section C
</p>
<p>
    C. Sensitivity and Adaptive Capacity
</p>
<p>
    Notes: Specific instructions for each factor are as follows. Note that these factors relate to
    characteristics of the species only. Anthropogenic effects, such as on the
    availability of dispersal corridors, should not be considered in this
    section.
</p>
<p>
    1) Dispersal and Movements
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor pertains to known or predicted dispersal or movement
    capacities and characteristics and ability to shift location in the absence
    of barriers as conditions change over time as a result of climate change.
    Species in which individuals exhibit substantial dispersal, readily move
    long distances as adults or juveniles, or exhibit flexible movement
    patterns should be better able to track shifting climate envelopes than are
    species in which dispersal and movements are more limited or inflexible.
    This factor pertains specifically to dispersal through unsuitable habitat,
    which, in most cases, is habitat through which propagules or individuals
    may move but that does not support reproduction or long-term survival. If
    all habitat is regarded as suitable (i.e., species can reproduce and
    persist in every habitat in which it occurs), then dispersal ability is
    assessed for suitable habitat. If appropriate, scoring of species whose
    dispersal capacity is not known can be based on characteristics of closely
    related species (or species of similar body size in the same major group)
    with similar and relevant morphological features.
</p>
<p>
    Barriers, which are here defined as features or areas that completely or
    almost completely block dispersal, are treated in factor B2. If a species
    requires other species for propagule dispersal, please also complete factor
    C4d. The following categorization for plants is loosely based on Vittoz and
    Engler (2007 Botanica Helvetica 117:109–124).
</p>
<p>
    A small number of species are confined by barriers to areas that are
    smaller than the species' potential dispersal distance (fishes in small
    isolated springs or plants that only occur in vernal pools are classic
    examples). Most if not all of the fish species that occur in the smallest
    such habitat patches could disperse farther than the greatest extent of the
    occupied patch if a larger extent of habitat were available to them. For
    the purposes of this factor, the dispersal ability of these species is
    scored as if the species occurred in a large patch of habitat (longer than
    the dispersal distance), based on dispersal or movement patterns or
    capabilities of closely related species (or species of similar body size in
    the same major group of animals).
</p>
<p>
    Migratory species should be scored according to their ability to shift
    their distribution within the assessment area during the period of
    occupation or from one year to the next (whichever is larger).
</p>
<p>
    Species in which propagule dispersal is both synchronous among all members
    of the population in the assessment area and infrequent (average of several
    years between successful reproduction events) should be scored as one
    category more vulnerable than the category that would otherwise apply. An
    example is the monocarpic giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea), a bamboo
    species that reproduces synchronously every 25-50 years and then dies.
</p>
<p>
    TOOLS: Seed biological trait data for some species can be found at
    http://data.kew.org/sid/sidsearch.html.
</p>
<p>
    Greatly Increase Vulnerability: Species is characterized by severely
         restricted dispersal or movement capability. Species is represented by
         sessile organisms that almost never disperse more than 10 meters per
         dispersal event.
         </p>
           <p>
           Examples: plants with large or heavy propagules for which the disperser is
         extinct or so rare as to be ineffective; species with dispersal limited to
         vegetative shoots, buds, or similar structures that do not survive (at
                                                                             least initially) if detached from the parent; plants dispersed only
         ballistically.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Species is characterized by highly restricted
         dispersal or movement capability. Species rarely disperses through
         unsuitable habitat more than about 10-100 meters per dispersal event; OR
         dispersal beyond a very limited distance (or outside a small isolated patch
                                                   of suitable habitat) periodically or irregularly occurs but is dependent on
         highly fortuitous or rare events; OR species has substantial movement
         capability but exhibits a very high degree of site fidelity.
         </p>
           <p>
           Examples: branchiopods whose resting stages sometimes are transported in
         mud attached to birds or mammals; small clams that may disperse while
         clamped onto bird feathers or frog toes; small, nonvolant animals of
         relatively low vagility, including small, slow-moving animals such as
         slugs, snails, and the smallest terrestrial salamanders that rarely shift
         location by more than 100 meters within a single year; many ant-dispersed
         plant species; plant or animal species with free-living propagules or
         individuals that may be carried more than 100 meters by a tornado or
         unusually strong hurricane or large flood but that otherwise rarely
         disperse more than 100 meters; plants that do not fit criteria for Greatly
         Increase Vulnerability but lack obvious dispersal adaptations (i.e.,
                                                                        propagules lack any known method for moving more than 100 meters away from
                                                                        the source plant); birds that exhibit an extremely high degree of site
         fidelity or exceptionally low rate of colonization of vacant suitable
         habitat.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Species is characterized by limited or
         moderate but not highly or severely restricted dispersal or movement
         capability. A significant percentage (at least approximately 50%) of
         propagules or individuals disperse approximately 100-1,000 meters per
         dispersal event (rarely farther); OR species has substantial movement
         capability but exhibits a moderate to high degree of site fidelity and has
         very limited existing or potential habitat within the assessment area; OR
         dispersal likely is consistent with one of the following examples.
         </p>
           <p>
           Examples: species that exist in small isolated patches of suitable habitat
         but regularly disperse or move among patches that are up to 1,000 meters
         (rarely farther) apart; plants whose propagules are dispersed primarily by
         small animals (e.g., some rodents) that typically move propagules
         approximately 100-1,000 meters from the source (propagules may be cached or
                                                         transported incidentally on fur or feathers); plants dispersed by wind with
         low efficiency (e.g., species with inefficiently plumed seeds and/or that
                         occur predominantly in forests); many small but somewhat vagile animals
         (e.g., many small mammals and lizards); species whose individuals exist in
         small isolated patches of suitable habitat but regularly disperse or move
         among patches that are 100-1,000 meters (rarely farther) apart; plant and
         animal species whose propagules or individuals are dispersed by small
         animals (e.g., rodents, grouse) that regularly but perhaps infrequently
         move propagules approximately 100-1,000 meters from the source; many
         denning snakes and some pond-breeding amphibians that are otherwise
         terrestrial as adults) (note that these short-distance migratory animals
                                 may exhibit strong fidelity to natal areas but nevertheless generally
                                 include individuals that colonize or move into other nearby areas); birds
    that exhibit a high degree of site fidelity or relatively low rate of
    colonization of vacant suitable habitat (as in Increase Vulnerability but
                                             the degree site fidelity or colonization rate is not as extreme).
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Species is characterized by good to excellent dispersal or
    movement capability. Species has propagules or dispersing individuals that
    commonly move more than 1 kilometer from natal or source areas; OR species
    tends to occupy all or most areas of suitable habitat, or readily or
    predictably moves more than 1 kilometer to colonize newly available habitat
    (e.g., recently restored areas, areas that become suitable as a result of
      fire, insect infestations, or other environmental changes, etc.); OR
    dispersal capability likely is consistent with one of the following
    examples. Note that species in the Neutral category are not necessarily
    'early successional' or 'r-selected' species but also may include
    certain 'late successional' or equilibrium ('K-selected') species that
    have excellent innate or vector-aided dispersal capability.
    </p>
      <p>
      Examples: plant species regularly dispersed more than 1 km by large or
    mobile animals (e.g., plant has seeds that are cached, regurgitated, or
                    defecated at least 1 km from the source by birds [e.g., corvids, songbirds
                                                                      that eat small fleshy fruits] or mammals or that are transported on fur of
                    large mobile animals such as most Carnivora or ungulates); animal species
    that regularly disperse or move long distances via their own locomotory
    abilities (e.g., most large and some medium-sized mammals, most bats, many
               common birds); many plant species dispersed by wind with high efficiency
    (e.g., species with efficiently plumed seeds or very small propagules that
      occur predominantly in open areas); plant or animal species whose
    individuals often or regularly are dispersed more than 1 kilometer by air
    or ocean currents, or humans, including species that readily become
    established outside their native ranges as a result of intentional or
    unintentional translocations by humans; animal species whose populations
    within the assessment area are known to migrate facultatively according to
    changing environmental conditions (e.g., some northern finches and owls
                                       exhibit short or long migrations in some years but not in others);
    nonmigratory species whose populations may shift location by 1 kilometer or
    more in response to changing environmental conditions (e.g., the
                                                           black-backed woodpecker [Picoides arcticus] often makes substantial shifts
                                                           in its distribution in accordance with concentrations of wood-boring
                                                           insects); migratory species that show clear ability to track variable
    resources over broad geographies; bird species lacking a high degree of
    site fidelity; bird species that readily colonize vacant suitable habitat.
</p>
<p>
2) Predicted Sensitivity to Temperature and Moisture Changes
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor pertains to the breadth of temperature and precipitation
    conditions, at both broad and local scales, within which a species is known
    to be capable of reproducing, feeding, growing, or otherwise existing.
    Species with narrow environmental tolerances/requirements may be more
    vulnerable to habitat loss from climate change than are species that thrive
    under diverse conditions.
</p>
<p>
    b) Predicted sensitivity to changes in precipitation, hydrology, or
    moisture regime.
</p>
<p>
    ii) Physiological hydrological niche
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor pertains to a species' dependence on a narrowly defined
    precipitation/hydrologic regime, including strongly seasonal precipitation
    patterns and/or specific aquatic/wetland habitats (e.g., certain springs,
    vernal pools, seeps, seasonal standing or flowing water) or localized
    moisture conditions that may be highly vulnerable to loss or reduction with
    climate change. Dependence may be permanent or seasonal, and for migratory
    species may include staging areas, migration stops, and wintering areas
    outside the assessment area. Aquatic cave obligate species are considered
    here according to their hydrological needs and habitat vulnerability.
    Species nesting on islands in lakes, reservoirs, and/or wetlands that
    prevent predator access can be scored here to the extent that a changed
    hydrological regime may influence the availability of these predator-free
    breeding sites (for example, birds nesting on islands to avoid predation by
    mammals). If a species is dependent on aquatic/wetland habitats that are
    actively managed to maintain a particular hydrology, consider whether this
    management would be sufficient to ameliorate projected climate change
    impacts (and, if so, score as Neutral).
</p>
<p>
    For plant species, the advantage of the C4 photosynthetic pathway for water
    use efficiency will likely enable C4 plants to be less vulnerable to
    decline under drying conditions than C3 plants (Taylor et al. 2010, New
    Phytologist 185:780). The predicted vulnerability of these plants with
    respect to this factor has been adjusted accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    For nonmigratory species, 'range' refers to the range within the assessment
    area. For migratory species, 'range' encompasses the assessment area and
    additional areas (e.g., migration stops, staging areas, wintering areas)
    that are used to a significant extent by the populations being assessed.
    For example, a migratory bird species for which 95% of the significant
    migration stops are in shallow inland/interior wetlands should be assigned
    to the Greatly Increase Vulnerability category, even if the species is not
    dependent on such habitats within the assessment area.
</p>
<p>
    Note that temperature conditions and hydrological regimes often covary and
    often are not neatly separable. These situations should be scored under
    factor C2aii (Physiological Thermal Niche) if temperature per se appears to
    be the overriding factor; otherwise they should be scored here.
</p>
<p>
    Greatly Increase Vulnerability: Completely or almost completely (&gt;90%
                                                                      of occurrences or range) dependent on a specific aquatic/wetland habitat or
    localized moisture regime that is likely to be highly vulnerable to loss or
    reduction with climate change.
    </p>
      <p>
      Examples: species dependent on small/isolated/shallow water-bodies or
    wetlands in arid landscapes; ephemeral-pool-dependent branchiopods; plants
    that are exclusively or very strongly associated with localized moist
    microsites (e.g., hanging gardens in arid landscapes).
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Moderately (50-90% of occurrences or range)
    dependent on a strongly seasonal hydrologic regime and/or a specific
    aquatic/wetland habitat or localized moisture regime that is likely to be
    highly vulnerable to loss or reduction with climate change.
    </p>
      <p>
      Examples: certain amphibians that often breed in vernal pools but also
    regularly use other aquatic or wetland habitats; certain plants whose life
    cycles are highly synchronized with Mediterranean precipitation patterns in
    areas vulnerable to large changes in the amount and seasonal distribution
    of precipitation; desert or semidesert plants that frequently occur in but
    are not restricted to or almost restricted to moisture-accumulating
    microsites; plants (and animals that depend on these species) for which
    &gt;50% of populations occur in areas such as sandy soils that are highly
    prone to desiccation; plants that use the C4 photosynthetic pathway and
    that otherwise qualify for the Greatly Increase Vulnerability category.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Somewhat (10-50%) dependent on a strongly
    seasonal hydrologic regime and/or a specific aquatic/wetland habitat or
    localized moisture regime that is highly vulnerable to loss or reduction
    with climate change.
    </p>
      <p>
      Examples: plants (and animals that depend on these species) for which
    10-50% of populations occur in areas such as sandy soils that are sensitive
    to changes in precipitation; certain plants with ranges restricted to
    seasonal precipitation environments (e.g., summer rainfall deserts) and
    which have a moderate degree of adaptation to that seasonality; plants that
    use the C4 photosynthetic pathway and that otherwise qualify for the
    Increase Vulnerability category.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Species has little or no dependence on a strongly seasonal
    hydrologic regime and/or a specific aquatic/wetland habitat or localized
    moisture regime that is highly vulnerable to loss or reduction with climate
    change; OR hydrological requirements are not likely to be significantly
    disrupted in major portion of the range; OR species tolerates a very wide
    range of moisture conditions.
    </p>
      <p>
      Examples: water-limited species in areas with increasing water
    availability; arid-adapted species in areas with decreasing moisture
    availability; species dependent on springs tied to a regional aquifer that
    would not be expected to change significantly with climate change; aquatic
    species inhabiting caves fed by groundwater aquifers that are not expected
    to change significantly with climate change; plants that use the C4
    photosynthetic pathway and that otherwise qualify for the Somewhat Increase
    Vulnerability category.
</p>
<p>
    c) Dependence on a specific disturbance regime likely to be impacted by
    climate change
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor pertains to a species' response to specific disturbance
    regimes such as fires, floods, severe winds, pathogen outbreaks, or similar
    events. It includes disturbances that impact species directly as well as
    those that impact species via abiotic aspects of habitat quality. For
    example, changes in flood and fire frequency/intensity may cause changes in
    water turbidity, silt levels, and chemistry, thus impacting aquatic species
    sensitive to these aspects of water quality. The potential impacts of
    altered disturbance regimes on species that require specific river features
    created by peak flows should also be considered here; for example, some
    fish require floodplain wetlands for larval/juvenile development or high
    peak flows to renew suitable spawning habitat. Use care when estimating the
    most likely effects of increased fires; in many ecosystems, while a small
    increase in fire frequency might be beneficial, a greatly increased fire
    frequency could result in complete habitat destruction.
</p>
<p>
    Be sure to also consider species that benefit from a lack of disturbance
    and may suffer due to disturbance increases when scoring this factor.
</p>
<p>
    TOOLS: Information on fire effects:
    http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/index.html. For a map of modeled
    future fire regime, see Figure 2 in Krawchuk et al. (2009, PLoS ONE
    4:e5102).
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Strongly affected by specific disturbance regime,
    and climate change is likely to change the frequency, severity, or extent
    of that disturbance regime in a way that reduces the species' distribution,
    abundance, or habitat quality. For example, many sagebrush-associated
    species in regions predicted to experience increased fire
    frequency/intensity would be scored here due to the anticipated deleterious
    effects of increased fire on their habitat.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Moderately affected by specific
    disturbance regime, and climate change is likely to change the frequency,
    severity, or extent of that disturbance regime in a way that reduces the
    species' distribution, abundance, or habitat quality, OR strongly affected
    by specific disturbance regime, and climate change is likely to change that
    regime in a way that causes minor disruption to the species' distribution,
    abundance, or habitat quality. For example, plants in a riverscour
    community that are strongly tied to natural erosion and deposition flood
    cycles, which may shift position within the channel rather than disappear
    as a result of climate change.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Little or no response to a specific disturbance regime, OR climate
    change is unlikely to change the frequency, severity, or extent of that
    disturbance regime in a way that affects the range or abundance of the
    species, OR climate change is likely to change the characteristics of the
    disturbance regime in a way that increases the species' distribution.
</p>
<p>
    d) Dependence on ice, ice-edge, or snow cover habitats
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor pertains to a species' dependence on habitats associated
    with ice (e.g., sea ice, glaciers) or snow (e.g., long-lasting snow beds,
    avalanche chutes) throughout the year or seasonally during an essential
    period of the life cycle. For aquatic species, the importance of snowpack
    for maintaining downstream water temperatures should be considered here.
    'Range' refers to the range within the assessment area.
</p>
<p>
    Greatly Increase Vulnerability: Highly dependent (&gt;80% of subpopulations
    or range) on ice- or snow-associated habitats; or found almost exclusively
    on or near ice or snow during at least one stage of the life cycle. For
    example, polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is strongly dependent on sea ice
    throughout its range.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Moderately dependent (50-80% of subpopulations or
    range) on ice- or snow-associated habitats; or often found most abundantly
    on or near ice or snow but also regularly occurs away from such areas. For
    example, Kittlitz's murrelet (Brachyramphus brevirostris) feeding habitat
    is moderately to strongly associated with tidewater glaciers.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Somewhat (10-49% of subpopulations or
    range) dependent on ice- or snow-associated habitats, or may respond
    positively to snow or ice but is not dependent on it. For example, certain
    alpine plants are often associated with long-lasting snowbeds but also
    commonly occur away from such areas; certain small mammals experience
    increased survival and may develop relatively large populations under
    winter snow cover but do not depend on snow cover. Species that benefit
    from a minimum thickness of ice or snowpack for winter insulation should
    also be scored here.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Little dependence on ice- or snow-associated habitats (may be
    highly dependent in up to 10% of the range).
</p>
<p>
    3) Restriction to Uncommon Landscape/Geological Features or Derivatives
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor pertains to a species' need for a particular
    soil/substrate, geology, water chemistry, or specific physical or landscape
    feature (e.g., caves, cliffs, active sand dunes, islands) for reproduction,
    feeding, growth, shelter, or other aspects of the life cycle. It focuses on
    the commonness of suitable conditions for the species on the landscape, as
    indicated by the commonness of the features themselves combined with the
    degree of the species' restriction to them. Climate envelopes may shift
    away from the locations of fixed (within at least a 50 year timeframe)
    landscape or geological features or their derivatives, making species tied
    to these uncommon features potentially more vulnerable to habitat loss from
    climate change than are species that thrive under diverse conditions.
</p>
<p>
    This factor does NOT include habitat preferences based on temperature,
    hydrology, or disturbance regime, as these are covered elsewhere in the
    Index. For example, species dependent on springs or ephemeral pools should
    not be scored as more vulnerable for this factor solely on that basis
    (addressed under factor C2bii: Physiological Hydrological Niche). However,
    restriction to aquatic features with regionally uncommon water chemistry
    should be considered here. This factor also does NOT include habitat
    features such as stream riffles or basking rocks. Finally, this factor does
    NOT include biotic habitat components; for example, species that require
    features such as tree snags or a particular type/condition of plant
    community (e.g., old growth forest) should not be scored as more vulnerable
    for this factor.
</p>
<p>
    If the idea of specificity to soil/substrate, geology, or specific physical
    or landscape features is not relevant to the species (e.g., many birds and
    mammals), choose Neutral.

</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Highly dependent upon (i.e., more or less endemic
                                                    to, or &gt; 85% of occurrences found on) a particular highly uncommon
    landscape or geological feature or derivative (e.g., soil, water
                                                   chemistry).
    </p>
      <p>
      Examples: serpentine (broad and strict) endemic plants; plants of
    calcareous substrates where such substrates are uncommon (e.g., California,
                                                              karst in the southeastern U.S.); plants restricted to one or a few specific
    rock strata; species more or less restricted to inland sand dunes or shale
    barrens; obligate cave-dwelling organisms; springsnails restricted to
    springs with high dissolved CO2; fish species that require a highly
    uncommon substrate particle size, such as Colorado pikeminnows
    (Ptychocheilus lucius) that spawn only on rare cobble bars cleared of
    debris by seasonal high streamflows; many colonially nesting seabirds that
    are essentially restricted to predator-free islands for successful
    reproduction.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Moderately dependent upon a particular
    uncommon landscape or geological feature or derivative, i.e., (1) an
    indicator of but not an endemic to (65-85% of occurrences found on) the
    types of features described under Increase, OR (2) more or less restricted
    to a landscape or geological feature or derivative that is not highly
    uncommon within the species’ range, but is not one of the dominant types.
    </p>
      <p>
      Examples: as in Increase Vulnerability but with a lesser degree of
    dependence; species moderately restricted to active coastal sand dunes,
    cliffs, salt flats (including shorebirds that require sodic soils), inland
    waters within a particular salinity range, or nondominant rock types such
    as occasional igneous rock intrusions within a landscape mostly dominated
    by sedimentary and/or metamorphic rocks; species that inhabit multiple
    geological features each of which is uncommon; fish species that require a
    specific substrate particle size, if that of stream bottom type is not one
    of the dominant types within the species range.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Having a clear preference for (&gt; 85% of occurrences found on)
    a particular landscape or geological feature or derivative, but the
    feature/derivative is among the dominant types within the species’ range;
    OR somewhat flexible in dependence upon geological features or derivatives
    (i.e., found on a subset of the dominant substrate/water chemistry types
    within its range); OR highly generalized relative to dependence upon
    geological features or derivatives; species is described as a generalist
    and/or occurrences have been documented on widely varied substrates or
    water chemistries.
</p>
<p>
    Examples: plants (e.g., red spruce) that are usually associated with acidic
    organic soils that are not uncommon within the range; many species whose
    habitat descriptions specify one pH category (acidic, neutral, or basic)
    and/or one soil particle size (e.g., rocky, sandy, or loamy) but that
    substrate type is not particularly uncommon within the species’ range;
    species inhabiting multiple relatively widespread geological features;
    species with many occurrences associated with both acidic and basic soils
    or waters, or with both sandy and clay soils); species not strongly tied to
    any specific landscape or geological feature or derivative, such as common
    yarrow (Achillea millefolium), coyote (Canis latrans), and many other
    plants and animals.
</p>
<p>
    4) Interspecific Interactions
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: The primary impact of climate change on many species may occur via
    effects on synchrony with other species on which they depend (Parmesan
    2006, ARES 37:637), rather than through direct physiological stress.
</p>
<p>
    a) Dependence on other species to generate habitat
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor pertains to a species’ dependence on uncommon/restricted
    habitats that are generated or maintained by other species. Species that
    are dependent on a small number of other species likely are more vulnerable
    to climate change than are species that have more flexibility or that do
    not have specialized habitat requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Habitat refers to any habitat (e.g., for reproduction, feeding,
    hibernation, seedling establishment) necessary for completion of the life
    cycle, including those used only on a seasonal basis. This includes
    specific (often structural) features within a more generalized habitat type
    (e.g., burrows created by other species in a grassland habitat;
    woodpecker-created cavities in a forest habitat). These habitats must be
    required for completion of the life cycle (e.g., reproduction, feeding,
    hibernation, seedling establishment, etc.) and may include habitats used
    only on a seasonal basis. For plants, species-specific relationships
    involved in creating specific habitat conditions necessary for seedling
    establishment should be considered here; nutritional relationships
    necessary for seedling establishment (e.g., parasitic or obligately
    myco-heterotrophic plants) should be considered under C4g. The relationship
    between freshwater mussels and their larval hosts should be scored only
    under factor C4d (Dependence on other species for propagule dispersal).
</p>
<p>
    This factor is concerned specifically with habitats generated or maintained
    by particular species and does NOT include ecological dependencies based
    primarily on disturbance regime, geological features, or diet, as these are
    covered elsewhere in the Index. Required habitats involving
    temperature/hydrological conditions that are generated by a small number of
    particular species are included in this factor, but
    temperature/hydrology-related habitats that are not primarily species
    dependent are considered under C2aii and C2bii (thermal and hydrological
    niches); if in doubt, score under C2aii or C2bii.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Required habitat is generated primarily by one
    species.
</p>
<p>
    Examples: several insect species (e.g., the beetle Onthophilus giganteus)
    that depend entirely on southeastern pocket gopher (Geomys pinetis) tunnels
    for required habitat; the spider Masoncus pogonophilus, which depends on
    habitat provided by colony chambers of the Florida harvester ant
    (Pogonomyrmex badius); lichens (e.g., Nephroma occultum) strongly
    associated with old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest; animals that
    require marshes dominated by a single plant species (such as Spartina sp.
    or Typha sp.).
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Required habitat is generated by only a
    few species.
</p>
<p>
    Examples: certain cacti that depend on a few specific plant species for
    creating required specific habitat conditions necessary for seedling
    establishment; plants species that depend on biological soil crusts for
    favorable conditions for seed germination, water and nutrient flow to
    vegetation, and soil stability; plant species with preference for
    particular canopy species like long leaf pine (Pinus palustris); species
    such as nesting burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) that depend on
    excavations made by relatively few species of burrowing mammals; birds such
    as marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) that strongly depend on a
    few species of large trees to provide suitable nesting platforms; certain
    plant species that depend on large grazing animals to generate habitats
    (localized disturbances) required for establishment and early growth.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Required habitat is generated by more than a few species; or
    species does not require any uncommon/restricted habitats; or habitat
    requirements do not involve species-specific processes.
</p>
<p>
    Examples: many mammal species that do not rely on burrows or shelters made
    by one or a few other species; many bird species that do not depend on one
    or a few other species to provide suitable nesting or foraging sites; most
    species of reptiles, amphibians, fishes, aquatic invertebrates, and
    butterflies and moths; epiphytic species (orchids, lichens, bromeliads)
    with no host preference; many species of forest understory plants that
    thrive under a wide range of forest tree species.
</p>
<p>
    b) Dietary versatility (animals only)
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor pertains to the diversity of food types consumed by
    animal species. Dietary specialists are more likely to be negatively
    affected by climate change than are species that readily switch among
    different food types.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the relationship between freshwater mussels and their larval
    hosts should be scored only under factor C5d (Dependence on other species
    for propagule dispersal).
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Completely or almost completely (&gt;90%)
    dependent on one species during any part of the year; equivalent
    alternatives to this single-species food resource are not readily
    available.
</p>
<p>
    Examples: Clarks nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), which depends heavily
    on the seeds of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis); red knot, some
    populations of which during spring migration may be completely or almost
    completely dependent on horseshoe crab (Limulus) eggs.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: 'Completely or almost completely (&gt;90%)
    dependent during any part of the year on (1) a few species from a
    restricted taxonomic group or (2) a narrow guild the members of which are
    thought to respond similarly to climate change.
    </p>
      <p>
      Examples: larvae of various fritillary butterflies that rely heavily on a
    few species of Viola violets; great purple hairstreak (Atlites halesus),
    which is dependent on a few mistletoe species; swifts and swallows that are
    dependent on aerial insects (often a limited number of species at any
                                 particular time) that may become unavailable or less available as a result
    of climate change (e.g., through increased incidence of prolonged rainy
                       conditions that restrict aerial feeding opportunities, or increased
                       incidence of conditions that reduce populations of aerial insects).'
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: 'Diet flexible; during any season species readily switches among
    multiple food resources according to availability; not strongly dependent
    on one or a few species; omnivorous, with diet including numerous species
    of both plants and animals.
    </p>
      <p>
      Examples: most Carnivora, ungulates, nonmigratory birds, amphibians,
    reptiles, fishes, and many Lepidoptera (e.g., mule deer seasonally may
                                            focus their foraging on only a few favored plant species, but in the
                                            absence of those species they readily switch to other species); great
    horned owl (Bubo virginianus), which has a flexible diet and is not
    strongly dependent on one or a few species (although its diet may be
                                                dominated by one or a few readily available species in a particular
                                                location or season); black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) and
    other birds that are highly opportunistic during any season and readily
    switch among different food resources as availability changes.'
</p>
<p>
    c) Pollinator versatility (plants only)
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: Quantitative thresholds loosely follow data in Waser et al. (1996,
    Ecology 77:1043). If appropriate, scoring of species whose pollinators is
    not known can be based on characteristics of closely related species that
    have similar and relevant morphological floral features that may have
    similar pollination syndromes (Willmer 2011, Pollination and Floral
    Ecology, Princeton Press).
</p>
<p>
    In some cases, sympatric, sequentially flowering species may enhance
    reproductive success for each other through maintenance of pollinator
    populations. Species that are documented to benefit from such interactions
    with one or only a few sympatric species should be scored one category
    higher (Hegland et al. 2009, Ecology Letters 12:184).
</p>
<p>
    TOOLS: 'The Inouye Pollinator Reference Database is a source for literature
    references to pollination:
      http://www.mendeley.com/groups/2544001/inouye-pollinator-reference-database/.
    </p>
      <p>
      A table describing traits of pollinator syndromes can be found at
    http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/pollinators/What_is_Pollination/syndromes.shtml.'
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Completely or almost completely dependent on one
    species for pollination (&gt; 90% of effective pollination accomplished by
    1 species) or, if no observations exist, morphology suggests very
    significant limitation of potential pollinators (e.g., very long corolla
    tube).
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Completely or almost completely dependent
    on 2-4 species for pollination (&gt; 90% of effective pollination
    accomplished by 2-4 species) or, if no observations exist, morphology
    suggests conformation to a specific 'pollination syndrome' (e.g., van der
    Pijl 1961, Evolution 15: 44-59,
    http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/pollinators/syndromes.shtml).
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Pollination apparently flexible; five or more species make
    significant contributions to pollination or, if no observations exist,
    morphology does not suggest pollinator limitation or pollination syndrome.
    Score wind-pollinated species as Neutral.
</p>
<p>
    d) Dependence on other species for propagule dispersal
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: Can be applied to plants or animals. Examples: Different species of
    freshwater mussels can be dispersed by one to many fish species; fruit
    dispersal by animals.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Completely or almost completely (roughly &gt; 90%)
    dependent on a single species for propagule dispersal.For example,
    whitebark pine would fit here because Clark's nutcracker is the primary
    dispersal agent.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Completely or almost completely (roughly
    &gt; 90%) dependent on a small number of species for propagule dispersal.
    For example, a freshwater mussel for which only a few species of fish can
    disperse larvae.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Disperses on its own (most animals, wind-dispersed plants) OR
    propagules can be dispersed by more than a few species (many plants).
</p>
<p>
    e) Sensitivity to pathogens or natural enemies
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor refers to pathogens and natural enemies (e.g.,
    predators, parasitoids, or herbivores) that can increase or become more
    pathogenic due to climate change, or vectors of disease when they expand
    their distributions due to changes in climate and therefore become more
    harmful or influence a greater portion of the distribution of the species
    being evaluated. Examples include the chytrid fungal pathogen that can
    become more harmful to frogs because of climate change (Pounds et al. 2006
    Nature 439:161) or sudden oak death in California caused by a pathogen that
    is invasive under favorable climate conditions (Meentenmeyer et al. 2011
    Ecosphere 2:1).
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Species is negatively affected to a high degree by
    a pathogen or natural enemy that is likely to increase in distribution,
    abundance, or impact as a result of climate change. Example: The
    cold-sensitive non-native hemlock woolly adelgid commonly causes a high
    level of mortality in eastern hemlock, and the
    distribution/abundance/impact of the adelgid may increase in areas where
    winter temperatures become milder.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Species is negatively affected to a
    moderate degree by a pathogen or natural enemy that is likely to increase
    in distribution, abundance, or impact as a result of climate change.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: There is no indication that the species is currently or in the
    foreseeable future likely to be significantly affected by a pathogen or
    natural enemy that is likely to increase in distribution, abundance, or
    impact as a result of climate change; OR the negative impact of pathogens
    or natural enemies is likely to decrease with climate change. Example: A
    warmer/drier climate may reduce the negative impact of certain fungal
    pathogens that depend/thrive on relatively cold/moist conditions.
</p>
<p>
    f) Sensitivity to competition from native or non-native species
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: Species may suffer when competitors are favored by both changing
    climates and the effects these climates have on disturbance regimes
    (Abatzoglou and Kolden 2011 Rangeland Ecology &amp; Management 64:471,
    Dukes et al. 2011 Ecological Applications 21:1887, Pintó-Marijuan and
    Munné-Bosch 2013, Grossman and Rice 2014 Ecology Letters 17:710). However,
    in some cases climate change will decrease the spread of particular
    invasive species (Bradley et al. 2010 Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution
    25:310). To score this factor, some indication is needed that a potential
    competitor is favored by projected future climates.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Strongly affected by a native or non-native
    competing species that is likely to be favored by climate change.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Moderately affected to a moderate degree
    by a native or non-native competing species that is likely to be favored by
    climate change.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Little or no response to a native or non-native species that is
    likely to shift its distribution or abundance due to climate change OR
    climate change is likely to decrease or have no effect on the spread or
    abundance of a native or non-native species that negatively impacts the
    species.
</p>
<p>
    g) Forms part of an interspecific interaction not covered by C5a-f
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: Can be applied to plants or animals. Here an interspecific
    interaction can include mutualism, parasitism, or commensalism. Refers to
    interactions unrelated to habitat, seedling establishment, diet,
    pollination, or propagule dispersal. For example, an acacia bush requiring
    an ant colony for protection against herbivores.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Requires an interaction with a single other species
    for persistence.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Requires an interaction with a one member
    of a small group of taxonomically related species for persistence. Could
    also include cases where specificity is not known for certain, but is
    suspected. Many Orchidaceae will be in this category because of their
    requirement for a specific fungal partner for germination (Tupac Otero and
    Flanagan 2006, TREE 21: 64-65).
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Does not require an interspecific interaction or, if it does, many
    potential candidates for partners are available.
</p>
<p>
    5) Genetic Factors
</p>
<p>
    a) Measured genetic variation
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: Species with less standing genetic variation will be less able to
    adapt because the appearance of beneficial mutations is not expected to
    keep pace with the rate of 21st century climate change. Throughout this
    question, 'genetic variation' may refer neutral marker variation,
    quantitative genetic variation, or both. To answer the question, genetic
    variation should have been assessed over a substantial proportion of a
    species' range.
</p>
<p>
    Because measures of genetic variability vary across taxonomic groups, there
    cannot be specific threshold numbers to distinguish among the categories.
    The assessor should interpret genetic variation in a species relative to
    that measured in related species to determine if it is low, high, or in
    between.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Genetic variation reported as 'very low' compared
    to findings using similar techniques on related taxa, i.e., lack of genetic
    variation has been identified as a conservation issue for the species.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Genetic variation reported as 'low'
    compared to findings using similar techniques on related taxa.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Genetic variation reported as 'average' or 'high' compared to
    findings using similar techniques on related taxa.
</p>
<p>
    b) Occurrence of bottlenecks in recent evolutionary history (use only if
    C5a is 'unknown')
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: In the absence of rangewide genetic variation information (C5a),
    this factor can be used to infer whether reductions in species-level
    genetic variation that would potentially impede its adaptation to climate
    change may have occurred. Only species that suffered population reductions
    and then subsequently rebounded qualify for the Somewhat Increase or
    Increase Vulnerability categories.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Evidence that total population was reduced to ≤ 250
    mature individuals, to one occurrence, and/or that occupied area was
    reduced by &gt;70% at some point in the past 500 years.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Evidence that total population was reduced
    to 251-1000 mature individuals, to less than 10 occurrences, and/or that
    occupied area was reduced by 30-70% at some point in the past 500 years.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: No evidence that total population was reduced to ≤ 1000 mature
    individuals and/or that occupied area was reduced by &gt; 30% at some point
    in the past 500 years.
</p>
<p>
    c) Reproductive system (plants only; use only if C5a and C5b are 'unknown')
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: In plants, genetic variation is strongly linked to reproductive
    mode. Therefore, in the absence of measured genetic variation and knowledge
    of recent genetic bottlenecks, a plant’s reproductive system may serve as a
    proxy for a species’ genetic variation or capacity to adapt to novel
    climatic conditions. For example, species that can outcross may be better
    able to adapt to novel environments (Morran et al. 2009, Morran et al.
    2011). Species with mixed mating systems, which make up 42% of the world’s
    flora, appear to favor selfing as a buffering mechanism to climate change
    (Jones et al. 2013).
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Genetic variation of the species is assumed to be
    'very low' in the assessment area because the species is restricted to
    asexual reproduction (vegetatively or apomicticly). These species are
    expected to be negatively impacted because rapid climate change can
    strongly impact genetic variation, ultimately reducing fitness (Jump and
    Penuelas 2005).
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Genetic variation assumed to be 'low' in
    the assessment area due to known disruptions or barriers to gene flow among
    subpopulations, range disjunctions, or documented outbreeding depression
    (Franks et al. 2014). Reproductive system may be either mixed or obligate
    outcrossing.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Genetic variation is assumed to be 'average' in the assessment
    area based on reproductive system. Includes species that have either mixed
    mating systems or are obligate outcrossers AND there are no known major
    disruptions to gene flow.
</p>
<p>
    6) Phenological Response to Changing Seasonal Temperature or Precipitation
    Dynamics
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: Recent research suggests that some phylogenetic groups are declining
    due to lack of response to changing annual temperature dynamics (e.g.,
    earlier onset of spring, longer growing season), including European bird
    species that have not advanced their migration times (Moller et al. 2008),
    and some temperate zone plants that are not moving their flowering times
    (Willis et al. 2008) to correspond to earlier spring onset. This may be
    assessed using either published multi-species studies such as those cited
    above or large databases such as that of the U.S. National Phenology
    Network.
</p>
<p>
    TOOLS: Some phenological information can be gleaned from papers listed in
    the Inouye Phenology Database,
    http://www.mendeley.com/groups/2544001/inouye-pollinator-reference-database/.
    The National Phenology Network website is http://www.usanpn.org/.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Seasonal temperature or precipitation dynamics
    within the species' range show detectable change, but phenological
    variables measured for the species show no detectable change.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Seasonal temperature or precipitation
    dynamics within the species' range show detectable change, and phenological
    variables measured for the species show some detectable change, but the
    change is significantly less than that of other species in similar habitats
    or taxonomic groups.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Seasonal temperature or precipitation dynamics within the species'
    range show detectable change, and phenological variables measured for the
    species show detectable change which is average compared to other species
    in similar habitats or taxonomic groups; OR seasonal dynamics within the
    species' range show no detectable change.

    D. Documented or Modeled Response to Climate Change (optional)
</p>
<p>
    1) Documented Response to Recent Climate Change (e.g., range contraction or
    phenology mismatch with critical resources)
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor pertains to the degree to which a species is known to
    have responded to recent climate change based on published accounts in the
    peer-reviewed literature. Time frame for the reduction or increase is 10
    years or three generations, whichever is longer. Some examples include
    population declines due to phenology mismatches between species and
    critical food or pollinator resources, e.g., great tits (Parus major) or
    pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) with winter moth (Operophtera
    brumata) caterpillars, or honey-buzzards (Pernis apivorus) with wasps.
</p>
<p>
    Note that not all responses to climate change necessarily indicate
    vulnerability. Species that respond to climate change by shifting (but not
    contracting) their range, for example, show adaptability to climate change
    and should be scored as Neutral for this factor. Similarly, species that
    respond by changing their phenology (without a related decline in
    population) should also be scored as Neutral.
</p>
<p>
    Greatly Increase Vulnerability: Distribution or abundance undergoing major
    reduction (&gt;70% over 10 years or three generations) believed to be
    associated with climate change.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Distribution or abundance undergoing moderate
    reduction (30-70% over 10 years or three generations) believed to be
    associated with climate change.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Distribution or abundance undergoing small
    but measureable (10-30% over 10 years or three generations) believed to be
    associated with climate change.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Distribution and abundance not known to be decreasing with climate
    change. Includes species undergoing range shifts without loss of
    distributional area or species undergoing changes in phenology but no net
    loss in range size or population size. Includes species in which climate
    change is documented to be causing an increase in range size or abundance.
</p>

<p>
    4) Occurrence of Protected Areas in Modeled Future (2050) Distribution
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: 'Protected area' refers to existing parks, refuges, wilderness
    areas, and other designated conservation areas that are relatively
    invulnerable to outright habitat destruction from human activities and that
    are likely to provide suitable conditions for the existence of viable
    populations of the species. Models of current and projected future ranges
    should meet standards described in the notes for D2. Modeled future
    distribution may refer to a single season (e.g., breeding season
    distribution or winter distribution) for migratory species. This factor
    considers ranges and protected areas within the assessment area only.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: &lt; 5% of the modeled future distribution within
    the assessment area is encompassed by one or more protected areas.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: 5-30% of the modeled future distribution
    within the assessment area is encompassed by one or more protected areas.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: &gt;30% of the modeled future distribution within the assessment
    area is encompassed by one or more protected areas.

</p>
<p>
    2) Modeled Future (2050) Change in Range or Population Size
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: This factor can include both distribution models and population
    models. Models should be developed based on reasonably accurate locality
    data (error &lt; 5km) using algorithms that are supported by peer-reviewed
    literature. Areas of obvious overprediction should be removed from current
    and predicted future distributions. Projections should be based on 'middle
         of the road' climate scenarios for the year 2050. Range size should be
    based on 'extent of occurrence' sensu IUCN Red List. Population models
    should be based on known processes as described in peer-reviewed
    literature. Examples include (a) phenological changes that are likely to
    result in a mismatch with critical dietary, pollination, or habitat
    resources (Visser and Both 2005) or (b) documented narrow temperature
    tolerances and thermal safely levels, particularly in insects (Deutsch et
    al. 2008, Calosi et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>
    If necessary, check multiple boxes to reflect variation in model output.
</p>
<p>
    Greatly Increase Vulnerability: Predicted future range disappears entirely
    from the assessment area OR predicted future abundance declines to zero as
    a result of climate change processes.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Predicted future range represents 50-99% decrease
    relative to current range within the assessment area OR predicted future
    abundance represents 50-99% decrease associated with climate change
    processes.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Predicted future range represents a 20-50%
    decrease relative to current range within the assessment area OR predicted
    future abundance represents 20-50% decrease associated with climate change
    processes.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Predicted future range represents an increase, no change, or a
    decrease of less than a 20% relative to current range within the assessment
    area OR predicted future abundance increases, remains stable, or decreases
    &lt; 20% as a result of climate change processes.
</p>
<p>
    3) Overlap of Modeled Future (2050) Range with Current Range
</p>
<p>
    NOTES: Distribution models of current and projected future ranges should
    meet standards described in the notes for D2. Overlap is calculated as the
    percent of the current range represented by an intersection of the
    predicted future and current ranges. If the range disappears or declines
    &gt; 70% within the assessment area, such that factor D2 is coded as
    Greatly Increase Vulnerability, this factor should be skipped to avoid
    double-counting model results.
</p>
<p>
    Greatly Increase Vulnerability: There is no overlap between the current and
    predicted future range within the assessment area.
</p>
<p>
    Increase Vulnerability: Predicted future range overlaps the current range
    by 30% or less within the assessment area.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat Increase Vulnerability: Predicted future range overlaps the
    current range by 30-60% within the assessment area.
</p>
<p>
    Neutral: Predicted future range overlaps the current range by &gt; 60%
    within the assessment area.
