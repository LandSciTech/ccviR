NatureServe CCVI rapid assessment tool designed allow relative grouping unrelated taxa vulnerability climate change highlight factors contribute climate change vulnerability individual species groups taxa. Outputs NatureServe CCVI can inform conservation decisions identify actions increase species’ resilience climate change. See Young et. al (2012), Young et. al. (2015) NatureServe CCVI Guidelines detailed descriptions index created. Recently NatureServe produced new version CCVI, Version 4.0. new version builds Version 3.02 significantly changes vulnerability questions, exposure calculation scoring algorithm. version CCVI available Excel Spreadsheet interactive webpage version released Canada. improvements Version 4.0, many changes yet peer-reviewed tool widely used far. hand, previous version NatureServe CCVI used extensively State Wildlife Action Plans US reviewed several peer-reviewed papers (Young, Dubois, Rowland 2015; Young et al. 2012). Therefore, continue use Version 3.02 consider adopting improvements Version 4.0 future. CCVI designed assess climate change vulnerability terrestrial aquatic plants, animals (including migratory species), lichens, within defined geographic area USA Canada (.e., North America). index contemplates vulnerability based projected change climate baseline 1961-1990 year 2050. NatureServe CCVI combines several components contribute species’ vulnerability climate change (Figure 1.1). include, exposure changes temperature moisture (Section ), indirect exposure changes brought climate change (e.g. sea level rise; Section B), traits related species’ sensitivity ability adapt climate change (Section C). also optionally incorporates results documented modeled responses climate change (Section D; Young et al. (2012); Young et al. (2016)). resulting CCVI ranks include: ‘Less Vulnerable’, ‘Moderately Vulnerable’, ‘Highly Vulnerable’, ‘Extremely Vulnerable’ ‘Insufficient Evidence’. Exposure assessed determining proportion species’ range falls six classes temperature moisture change, used assign exposure multiplier. vulnerability factors Sections B, C optionally D scored scale ‘neutral’ (score: 0) ‘greatly increases vulnerability’ (score: 3). indirect exposure, sensitivity adaptive capacity scores multiplied exposure multiplier summed. final CCVI value result applying thresholds total scores balancing sensitivity adaptive capacity rank documented modeled response rank. See Section 7 detailed explanation scoring algorithm. Figure 1.1: NatureServe CCVI calculated combining exposure climate change indirect exposure, sensitivity adaptive capacity determine CCVI index value.
