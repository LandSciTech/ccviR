Description: The ccviR package implements the 
  NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) version 3.02 <https://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/climate-change-vulnerability-index>
  in an R package and Shiny App. The package allows all of the geospatial
  aspects of calculating the CCVI to be done in R, removing the need for 
  separate GIS calculations. It also enables easier sensitivity analysis 
  of the Index. The app provides an interactive application designed to 
  offer a user-friendly and simple interface for calculating the NatureServe
  CCVI. See Young et. al (2012) <doi:10.7208/9780226074641-007> and 
  Young et. al. (2015) <doi:10.1002/wsb.478> for a detailed description of the 
  index.
