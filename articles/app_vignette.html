</h2>
<p>The ccviR app implements the <a href="https://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/climate-change-vulnerability-index" class="external-link">NatureServe
Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI)</a> in a Shiny App. The app
allows all of the geospatial aspects of calculating the CCVI to be done
in R, removing the need for separate GIS calculations. It also includes
new features and enhanced user friendliness to make it easier to
calculate the index and explore the results.</p>
<p>The NatureServe CCVI is a trait based climate change vulnerability
assessment framework. It includes three commonly used components of
vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. In addition,
it optionally incorporates the results of documented or modeled
responses to climate change.</p>
<p>Exposure is assessed by determining the proportion of the species
range that falls into 6 classes of temperature and moisture change which
is used to assign an exposure multiplier. Sensitivity and adaptive
capacity are assessed by scoring 23 vulnerability factors, on a scale
from 0 (‘neutral’) to 3 (‘greatly increases vulnerability’). These
scores are then multiplied by the exposure multiplier and are summed to
give a total score for this section. Factors that cannot be answered can
be left blank and contribute 0 to the total score. If fewer than 13
factors are scored the index value cannot be calculated.</p>
<p>In addition, there are 4 vulnerability factors for documented or
modeled responses to climate change that can optionally be scored on a
similar scale. These scores are simply summed to get the total score for
this section. An index value is then determined for the two sections
(exposure <em>x</em> sensitivity and adaptive capacity, and documented
or modeled responses) by applying a set of thresholds to the scores. The
two index values are then combined using a table that gives more weight
to the sensitivity and adaptive capacity section. The possible index
values are Less Vulnerable, Moderately Vulnerable, Highly Vulnerable,
Extremely Vulnerable or Insufficient Evidence (if not enough factors of
the CCVI are scored).</p>
<p>For more detailed information on how the index works and how each
factor is scored see the <a href="https://www.natureserve.org/sites/default/files/guidelines_natureserveclimatechangevulnerabilityindex_r3.02_1_jun_2016.pdf" class="external-link">NatureServe
CCVI Guidelines</a> and the references below.</p>

</h2>
<p>Before using the app to assess a real species we recommend walking
through the app with the demo data set provided.</p>
<p>If you have not already installed ccviR, begin by installing the
ccviR package from <a href="https://github.com/" class="external-link">GitHub</a> with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting started<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#getting-started"></a>
</h3>
<p>Upon launching the app, you are greeted with the Welcome Tab which
provides information on the Index and the data needed to calculate it.
Data needed to calculate the Index includes a climate data set,
species-specific spatial data sets, and species-specific sensitivity and
life history data.</p>
<p>The species-specific spatial datasets that can be provided are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Species North American or global range polygon (required): The
complete area occupied by the species in North America.</li>
<li>Assessment area polygon (required): The area within which the
species vulnerability is being assessed. For example, a country,
province, state, or protected area.</li>
<li>Physiological thermal niche (PTN) polygon: The PTN polygon should
include cool or cold environments occupied by the species that may be
lost or reduced in the assessment area as a result of climate
change.</li>
<li>Non-breeding range polygon: If applicable, the area outside North
America occupied in the non-breeding season.</li>
<li>Projected range change raster: The modeled change in the species
range caused by climate change. The values of the raster cells should
indicate whether the cell was lost, maintained, gained or was never
included in the range.</li>
</ul>
<p>The species range and assessment area are required but other spatial
data sets are optional. If the non-breeding range is not included the
migratory exposure index will not be calculated. If spatial data for the
projected range change or PTN are not provided these factors can be
filled in manually based on non-spatial information. All polygon data
should be provided as a shapefile while raster data can be in any file
format accepted by the <code><a href="https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/rast.html" class="external-link">terra::rast</a></code> function but “.tif”
files are recommended.</p>
<p>For this demonstration, all of the data is provided in the package.
This includes a small climate change data set covering New Brunswick for
the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emissions scenarios, a species range polygon, an
assessment area polygon, a PTN polygon, and range change rasters for
both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.</p>
<p>Press “Start” to begin calculating the index.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="species-information">Species Information<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#species-information"></a>
</h3>
<p>On this page, you will provide some basic details about the species.
Make sure to select the appropriate taxonomic group since some aspects
of the index are conditional on this. To better understand the meaning
of the cave dwelling and migratory check boxes see the NatureServe
Guidelines.</p>
<p>For this demonstration select “Vascular Plant” from the Major
Taxonomic Group drop down. Do not check the cave dwelling or migratory
boxes. Input any text for the remaining boxes. Click “Next”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="spatial-data-analysis">Spatial Data Analysis<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-data-analysis"></a>
</h3>
<p>On this page, you will load the spatial data used by the index and
run the spatial analysis for exposure to climate change. For the “Folder
location of prepared climate data” you need to tell the app where you
stored the climate data that it should use. For a real assessment this
will either be the folder that you unzipped the downloaded climate data
into or the output folder you selected in the data preparation app. For
this demonstration the prepared climate data can be found under
“clim_files &gt; processed”. Click on the processed folder then click
Select in the bottom right of the pop-up.</p>
<p><img src="clim_dir.PNG" style="width:80.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>Next, select the range polygon for the species (“rng_poly.shp”), the
assessment area polygon (“assess_poly.shp”), and the physiological
thermal niche polygon (“ptn_poly.shp”). Leave the non-breeeding range
blank since we are assuming this species is not migratory.</p>
<p>For the projected range change raster, select “Yes, multiple range
change rasters will be provided, one for each scenario.” This will open
a new section where you can select a raster file for each scenario.
Select “rng_chg_45.tif” for the RCP 4.5 scenario and “rng_chg_85.tif”
for the RCP 8.5 scenario. If range change rasters are not available for
each scenario, a single raster can be used but this assumes the
projected range change is the same in all scenarios.</p>
<p><img src="rng_chng_multi.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>Next, specify how the input raster should be classified into lost,
gained, maintained or not suitable. The classification will depend on
the values of the raster you are working with. For this demonstration,
use the default values which are for a raster where lost is -1,
maintained in 0, and gained is 1. Not suitable is not used so it is
flagged with 99.</p>
<p>The the gain multiplier allows you to ignore gains by setting it to 0
but we will leave it at 1 which assumes that the model has already
accounted for whether habitat gains are likely to be realized.</p>
<p><img src="gain_mod_run.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>Then, click “Run”. A loading symbol will appear while the data is
being processed. When the “Spatial analysis complete” message appears,
click “Next”. To see messages explaining what the spatial analysis is
doing look at the console in R studio.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="exposure-results">Exposure Results<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exposure-results"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Exposure Results page displays the results of the spatial data
analysis as interactive maps of climate change exposure. Exposure is
determined by the change in temperature or moisture that is expected to
occur in the future within the species range in the assessment area.</p>
<p>The exposure maps are created by subtracting the future climate from
the historical climate and classifying the results into six classes (low
to high level of exposure) based on the median and 1/2 the interquartile
range. Thus, negative values for temperature indicate warmer conditions
(°C) and negative values for moisture (mm) indicate drier conditions.
The tables below the maps outline the classes and the proportion of the
species range in each class. The exposure multiplier is determined by
the level of exposure. It is used to modify the sensitivity and adaptive
capacity components of the index based on exposure to climate
change.</p>
<p>To view the map for different scenarios uncheck the box next to the
last layer to reveal the one underneath. The real climate data will
cover all of North America but for the demonstration we are using a
subset from New Brunswick.</p>
<p><img src="temp_exp1.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p><img src="temp_exp2.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>The non-breeding range of the species is used to determine the
migratory exposure index based on the climate change exposure index
(CCEI). The CCEI is a metric of climate change exposure that indicates
the level of exposure to both temperature and moisture change using the
Euclidean distance. See the NatureServe guidelines for a full
description. Since our demonstration species is non-migratory this
section is blank.</p>
<p>Once you have finished exploring the maps click “Next”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="vulnerability-questions">Vulnerability Questions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#vulnerability-questions"></a>
</h3>
<p>Vulnerability questions are detailed questions that the index uses to
score the species’ indirect exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity and
modeled or documented responses to climate change. Descriptions of how
to interpret and score the questions are available in the NatureServe
guidelines which are included as a pop-up if you click the “Show
guidelines” button.</p>
<p><img src="vulnqs.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>For the demonstration, you can select any check box that you want for
each question. You can check more than one box to reflect uncertainty.
Questions that are unknown can be left blank. Try a few different
versions and see how it affects the result! For each question there is a
comment section that should be filled in with detailed information on
how the answer was reached and any evidence that was used to support the
assessment. The size of the comment box can be increased by dragging
from the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>There are three sections of vulnerability questions: <em>Section B:
Indirect Exposure to Climate Change</em>, <em>Section C: Sensitivity and
Adaptive Capacity</em>, and <em>Section D: Documented or Modeled
Response to Climate Change</em>. Section B and Section C are required -
if less than 10 of the 20 questions are answered the index result will
be “Insufficient Evidence”. Section D is optional - if none of the
questions are answered the index will be calculated without it.</p>
<p>Additional vulnerability questions are answered based on an analysis
of spatial data, these questions are dealt with on the next page. Click
“Next” to go to the next page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="spatial-vulnerability-questions">Spatial Vulnerability Questions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-vulnerability-questions"></a>
</h3>
<p>This tab includes the vulnerability questions that have a spatial
component. Each question includes a map and table showing how the data
has been summarized. The check box is pre-selected based on the spatial
data analysis but can be changed if needed.</p>
<p><img src="spat_vulnqs.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>The modeled response to climate change will be different depending on
the climate change scenario used so the modeled future range change map
includes a layer for each scenario which can be toggled on or off in the
same way as the exposure maps. The responses to these questions can not
be edited when multiple scenarios are used.</p>
<p><img src="spat_vulnqs2.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>Note that if the check box is changed and then the “Run” button on
the Spatial Analysis page is clicked again, you will see a warning that
the value of the check boxes on this page will be updated to the value
based on the re-run spatial analysis. The ‘Spatial Vulnerability
Questions’ comments will not be affected though, so you can explain the
reason for any adjustments in the comments and then remake those
adjustments if they are still applicable. If the spatial data for a
vulnerability question was not provided on the ‘Spatial Data Analysis’
tab then the map will not be included and the question can be answered
using non-spatial information or left blank for unknown.</p>
<p>For the demonstration, leave the check boxes as they are and then
click “Next”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="index-results">Index Results<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#index-results"></a>
</h3>
<p>On the Results page, click “Calculate” to calculate the index value.
Once loaded, the first section presents the Climate Change Vulnerability
Index and Migratory Exposure Index for each climate scenario.</p>
<p><img src="results_dials.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>The Data Completeness table highlights how many questions were
answered in each section. The index is more reliable when more questions
are answered.</p>
<p>To account for uncertainty in the vulnerability questions you can
provide more than one answer to each question. The overall index value
is calculated based on the average score for each question but the
uncertainty in the index value is also explored using Monte Carlo
simulations. In each simulation one of the selected values is picked for
each vulnerability question and the index is re-calculated. This is
repeated 1000 times. The Variation in Index bar chart shows the
proportion of simulations that had each index value for each scenario.
If all the simulations had the same index value then the uncertainty in
the answers to vulnerability questions does not influence the index. If
the index values are different then the index value is less certain.</p>
<p><img src="results_variation.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>The next graph shows how the scores based on the exposure and the
sensitivity and adaptive capacity are combined with the scores based on
the documented or modeled response to climate change, to produce the
qualitative index value. The colours show the location of the thresholds
used to determine the index, the points show the score for each scenario
and the lines show the range of scores produced by the Monte Carlo
simulations.</p>
<p><img src="comb_ind_plot.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>The last graph shows the scores for each vulnerability factor in each
scenario. The scores reflect the the answer to the question and the
exposure multiplier that was applied. Use the mouse to show the pop-up
for each bar to get more details on how the score was reached.</p>
<p><img src="vulnq_plot.PNG" style="width:70.0%" fig-align="center"></p>
<p>If you go back and change the answer to a vulnerability question you
will need to click the “Calculate” button again to see the updated
results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="render-a-report">Render a report<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#render-a-report"></a>
</h3>
<p>You can generate a pdf report summarizing the results of the
assessment by clicking the “Generate report” button at the bottom of the
results page. The report produced will include the index value, a map of
the range, a map of the combined moisture and temperature exposure, and
the response to each vulnerability question as well as the text from the
comment section. Once rendered, the report will appear in your
downloads. Note this may take a long time the first time that you run it
since some LaTex packages will need to be installed.</p>

<p>Once you have completed the demonstration you are ready to use the
app with real world data.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="assemble-the-data">Assemble the data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assemble-the-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The first time you use the app you will need to acquire a climate
data set that includes the predicted future change in mean annual
temperature (MAT), and climate moisture deficit (CMD) as well as
historical mean annual precipitation and the difference between
historical maximum warmest month temperature (MWMT) and minimum coldest
month temperature (MCMT). The data is classified based on the median and
interquartile range for the future change in MAT and CMD and based on
thresholds defined by the NatureServe Guidelines for MAP and
MWMT-MCMT.</p>
<p>There are several versions of the data set available for download <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18mO5GDUmwi-nswhIAC36bmtYsvmqNQkH?usp=share_link" class="external-link">here</a>.
To use the data you need to download one of the files, unzip it and
store it in a convenient location. If you wish to create your own
climate data set for use with the index based on different climate data
you can follow the instructions in the “Preparing Custom Climate Data”
<a href="https://landscitech.github.io/ccviR/articles/data_prep_vignette.html">vignette</a>.
When using the app to assess multiple different species the same climate
data set should be used for all species so this step only needs to be
done once.</p>
<p>In addition to the climate data the following spatial data sets for
each species can be input:</p>
<ul>
<li>Species range polygon (required): Ideally this is the complete area
occupied by the species in North America since it is used to determine
the range of climate conditions that the species can tolerate.</li>
<li>Assessment area polygon (required): The area within which the
species vulnerability is being assessed. For example, a country,
province, state, or protected area. This can also be a subset of the
species range if you are assessing sub-populations. This polygon is
overlapped with the range to determine the exposure to climate change in
the area of interest.</li>
<li>Physiological thermal niche (PTN) polygon: The PTN polygon should
include cool or cold environments occupied by the species that may be
lost or reduced in the assessment area as a result of climate
change.</li>
<li>Non-breeding range polygon: If applicable, the area outside North
America occupied in the non-breeding season.</li>
<li>Projected range change raster: The modeled change in the species
range caused by climate change. The values of the raster cells should
indicate whether the cell was lost, maintained, gained or was never
included in the range.</li>
</ul>
<p>The species range and assessment area are required but other spatial
data sets are optional. If the non-breeding range is not included the
migratory exposure index will not be calculated. If spatial data for the
projected range change or PTN are not provided these factors can be
filled in manually based on non-spatial information. All polygon data
should be provided as a shapefile while raster data can be in any file
format accepted by the <code><a href="https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/rast.html" class="external-link">terra::rast</a></code> function but “.tif”

</h3>
<p>The app is launched by calling the <code><a href="../reference/run_ccvi_app.html">run_ccvi_app()</a></code>
function, which will launch the app in the user’s default internet
browser. All file selection windows will start in the current working
directory. To run the app with data stored in a different folder you can
call <code><a href="../reference/run_ccvi_app.html">run_ccvi_app()</a></code> with the folder path as the first
argument. For example, if all of the data is stored in a subdirectory
named “data” of the RStudio project where I am calling the function I
would call <code>run_ccvi_app("data")</code> to avoid having to open the
data folder every time I select a file. Alternatively, the complete path
to the data folder can be supplied
e.g. “C:/Users/username/Documents/path/to/folder” (Note that paths in R
must be supplied using forward slashes).</p>

<h3 id="saving-the-app">Saving the app<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#saving-the-app"></a>
</h3>
<p>The state of the app can be saved by clicking the “Save progress”
button at the bottom of the app at any point in the assessment. Choose a
name and location to save a csv file with all the app content that is
easy to remember, you will need to find it again to load the saved app.
To load the app from a saved csv file click “Select file” under “Load
data from a previous assessment” at the bottom of the Welcome page and
select the saved csv file.</p>
<p>Note, only the path to the spatial data is stored, not the data
itself, so the app will not be able to load if data is moved or its name
is changed. If the data has moved, you will get an error message but you
can go back to the Spatial Analysis tab and select the new file location
and then press “Run” which will re-run the spatial analysis but keep the
answers to the non-spatial vulnerability questions from the saved
file.</p>
<p>Be sure to save your progress throughout the assessment to prevent
the loss of data. Refreshing the app or timing out will result in your
progress being lost. It is recommended that you save your progress
before you step away from the assessment for an extended period of time
or after you input data that would be difficult/time consuming to
reproduce (ex: filling out Vulnerability Questions).</p>
<p>To interpret the names of the columns in the saved csv file you can
download the column definitions from the bottom of the Welcome page.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="multiple-related-assessments">Multiple related assessments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#multiple-related-assessments"></a>
</h3>
<p>You can use a saved partially completed assessment as a template for
running multiple related assessments. For example, to assess multiple
populations of a species that are in different locations and may have
different stressors fill in the app with all the information that will
not change between populations and save the state of the app in a csv.
Use this csv to load the template assessment and then modify it for each
population and save the completed assessments in new csv files.</p>

</h2>
<p>If you have a problem in the app you can look at the output in the R
console for a clue about what is going wrong. The output will include
messages, warnings and any error messages that are produced. You can
ignore warnings unless something else has gone wrong. Most errors will
show in the app but in some situations the app will go grey and the
error message can be found in the R console.</p>
<p>If you have persistent problems with the app you can do the same
analysis using the ccviR package. You will often be able to figure out
what is causing the problem and return to the app. See
<code><a href="../articles/package_vignette.html">vignette("package_vignette", package = "ccviR")</a></code> for a
tutorial on how to use the package. Or if you are not an R user, contact
sarah.endicott at ec.gc.ca and I will try to help.</p>
