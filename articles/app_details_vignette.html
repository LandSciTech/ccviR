</h2>
<p>The NatureServe CCVI is a trait based climate change vulnerability
assessment framework. It includes three commonly used components of
vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. In addition,
it optionally incorporates the results of documented or modeled
responses to climate change.</p>
<p>Exposure is assessed by determining the proportion of the species
range that falls into 6 classes of temperature and moisture change which
is used to assign an exposure multiplier. Sensitivity and adaptive
capacity are assessed by scoring 23 vulnerability factors, on a scale
from 0 (‘neutral’) to 3 (‘greatly increases vulnerability’). These
scores are then multiplied by the exposure multiplier and are summed to
give a total score for this section. Factors that cannot be answered can
be left blank and contribute 0 to the total score. If fewer than 13
factors are scored the index value cannot be calculated.</p>
<p>In addition, there are 4 vulnerability factors for documented or
modeled responses to climate change that can optionally be scored on a
similar scale. These scores are simply summed to get the total score for
this section. An index value is then determined for the two sections
(exposure <em>x</em> sensitivity and adaptive capacity, and documented
or modeled responses) by applying a set of thresholds to the scores. The
two index values are then combined using a table that gives more weight
to the sensitivity and adaptive capacity section. The possible index
values are Less Vulnerable, Moderately Vulnerable, Highly Vulnerable,
Extremely Vulnerable or Insufficient Evidence (if not enough factors of
the CCVI are scored).</p>
<p>The NatureServe CCVI is a rapid assessment tool designed to allow a
relative grouping of unrelated taxa by vulnerability to climate change
and to highlight which factors contribute to the climate change
vulnerability of individual species or groups of taxa. This information
can be used to inform conservation decision making and to help identify
actions to increase species resilience to climate change.</p>
<p>For more detailed information on how the index works and how each
factor is scored see the <a href="https://www.natureserve.org/sites/default/files/guidelines_natureserveclimatechangevulnerabilityindex_r3.02_1_jun_2016.pdf" class="external-link">NatureServe
CCVI Guidelines</a> and the references below.</p>
<p>The ccviR app and package allow for the use of different climate data
sets as inputs to the index but it is important to note that, since the
index results in a qualitative index of the relative vulnerability to
climate change, only index values created using the same climate data
sets should be compared. When multiple scenarios are included in one
assessment the same thresholds for exposure categories should be used
across scenarios so that they can be compared. In the pre-prepared data
sets linked <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18mO5GDUmwi-nswhIAC36bmtYsvmqNQkH?usp=share_link" class="external-link">here</a>
this is achieved by determining thresholds for amount of change in
temperature or moisture based on the least extreme climate scenario and
applying the same thresholds to the more extreme climate scenario(s).
For example, in the <a href="https://landscitech.github.io/ccviR/articles/app_vignette.html#exposure-results">demonstration
used in the app vignette</a> the amount of change in the RCP 8.5
scenario is so much higher than in the RCP 4.5 scenario that the whole
area has the highest exposure class under RCP 8.5 where as the exposure
classes are evenly distributed under RCP 4.5</p>

<p>All polygon data should be provided as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" class="external-link">shapefile</a> while
raster data can be in any file format accepted by the
<code><a href="https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/rast.html" class="external-link">terra::rast</a></code> function but “.tif” files are recommended.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="climate-data">Climate data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#climate-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The first time you use the app you will need to acquire a climate
data set that includes the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predicted future change in mean annual temperature (MAT)</li>
<li>Predicted future change in climate moisture deficit (CMD)</li>
<li>Historical mean annual precipitation (MAT)</li>
<li>Difference between historical maximum warmest month temperature
(MWMT) and minimum coldest month temperature (MCMT)</li>
</ul>
<p>The data is classified based on the median and interquartile range
for the future change in MAT and CMD and based on thresholds defined by
the NatureServe Guidelines for MAP and MWMT-MCMT.</p>
<p>There are several versions of the climate data available for download
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18mO5GDUmwi-nswhIAC36bmtYsvmqNQkH?usp=share_link" class="external-link">here</a>.
To use the data you need to download one of the files, unzip it and
store it in a convenient location. If you wish to create your own
climate data set for use with the index based on different climate data
you can follow the instructions in the “Preparing Custom Climate Data”
<a href="https://landscitech.github.io/ccviR/articles/data_prep_vignette.html">vignette</a>.
When using the app to assess multiple different species the same climate
data set should be used for all species because the index is relative so
the results cannot be compared across different species if different
data sets are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="species-range-polygon-required">Species range polygon (required)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#species-range-polygon-required"></a>
</h3>
<p>Ideally this is the complete area occupied by the species in North
America. The full range is used to determine the range of climate
conditions that the species can tolerate to answer the questions about
historical thermal niche (C2ai) and historical hydrological niche
(Cb2i). The portion of the range that is within the assessment area (see
below) is used to determine the species exposure to climate change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="assessment-area-polygon-required">Assessment area polygon (required)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assessment-area-polygon-required"></a>
</h3>
<p>The area within which the species vulnerability is being assessed.
For example, a country, province, state, or protected area. This can
also be a subset of the species range if you are assessing
sub-populations. This polygon is intersected with the range to create
the polygon used to determine the exposure to climate change. The range
within the assessment area is overlain on the exposure raster and the
proportion of the range covered by each class is determined and used to
calculate exposure multipliers for temperature, moisture and a combined
multiplier. These exposure multipliers are used to modify the scores
from the sensitivity questions in order to reach the total score.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="physiological-thermal-niche-ptn-polygon-optional">Physiological thermal niche (PTN) polygon (optional)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#physiological-thermal-niche-ptn-polygon-optional"></a>
</h3>
<p>The PTN polygon should include cool or cold environments occupied by
the species that may be lost or reduced in the assessment area as a
result of climate change. This could include species restricted to frost
pockets, north-facing slopes, shady ravines, or alpine areas if these
are among the coldest areas in the assessment so the species is unlikely
to be able to shift within the assessment area if these cool areas are
lost. If spatial data for the PTN is not available the question can be
answered manually or left as unknown. It is rare to have spatial data
for the physiological thermal niche so it should be filled in manually
in most cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="non-breeding-range-polygon-optional">Non-breeding range polygon (optional)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#non-breeding-range-polygon-optional"></a>
</h3>
<p>If applicable, the area outside North America occupied in the
non-breeding season. Leave this blank for non-migratory species. This
polygon will be overlapped with the Climate Change Exposure Index (CCEI)
raster to calculate the migratory exposure index. A CCEI raster can be
downloaded from the <a href="https://www.natureserve.org/ccvi-species" class="external-link">NatureServe website</a>
and included in the climate data folder. If either the non-breeding
range polygon or the CCEI raster are not available or the migratory
species check box is not checked the migratory exposure index will not
be calculated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="projected-range-change-raster-optional">Projected range change raster (optional)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#projected-range-change-raster-optional"></a>
</h3>
<p>The modeled change in the species range caused by climate change. The
values of the raster cells should indicate whether the cell was lost,
maintained, gained or was never included in the range. The raster is
expected to be the result of some sort of modelling. For example, if an
SDM for the species under the current climate was used to predict the
current range and then it was projected on to a future climate scenario
the difference between these two rasters could be used to create a range
change raster. If both rasters are binary predictions of the species
presence then if the current was subtracted from the future -1 would
represent habitat lost, 0 maintained, and 1 gained. If raster data is
not available in the appropriate format then the question can be
answered manually or left blank if no model is available.</p>

<h3 id="sourcing-species-specific-data">Sourcing species specific data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sourcing-species-specific-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are many potential sources of range polygons for species. When
considering which data to use it is important to consider how different
choices might affect the index. For example, if a wide ranging species
occurs on both sides of a mountain range you might find a range polygon
that includes the tops of the mountains in the species range even though
the species likely cannot survive in those conditions. This can bias the
historical thermal and hydrological niches calculated in the index.
Therefore it is important to choose the range data carefully.</p>
<p>Some possible sources of range polygons are:</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="launching-the-app">Launching the app<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#launching-the-app"></a>
</h3>
<p>The app is launched by calling the <code><a href="../reference/run_ccvi_app.html">run_ccvi_app()</a></code>
function, which will launch the app in the user’s default internet
browser. All file selection windows will start in the current working
directory. To run the app with data stored in a different folder you can
call <code><a href="../reference/run_ccvi_app.html">run_ccvi_app()</a></code> with the folder path as the first
argument. For example, if all of my data is stored in a subdirectory of
the working directory named “data”, I would call
<code>run_ccvi_app("data")</code> to avoid having to open the data
folder every time I select a file. Alternatively, the complete path to
the data folder can be supplied
e.g. “C:/Users/username/Documents/path/to/folder” (Note that paths in R
must be supplied using forward slashes).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="multiple-related-assessments">Multiple related assessments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#multiple-related-assessments"></a>
</h3>
<p>You can use a saved partially completed assessment as a template for
running multiple related assessments. For example, to assess multiple
populations of a species that are in different locations and may have
different stressors, fill in the app with all the information that will
not change between populations and save the state of the app in a csv by
clicking “Save Progress”. Then for each population launch a new
assessment, click “Load from a previous assessment” and select your
template csv. Then modify it for the specific population and save the
completed assessment in a new csv file. You may also wish to complete
multiple assessments for a species if you want to enter different
answers for vulnerability questions depending on the climate change
scenario used. Multiple climate scenarios can be included in a single
assessment and will affect the exposure multiplier and optionally the
modelled response to climate change. However, all other vulnerability
questions are assumed to be constant across scenarios. For example, if
sea level rise was expected to have a different impact under RCP 8.5
than 4.5 you would need to perform two separate assessments to reflect
this.</p>
