# Code Design

Here are details regarding code design choices/decisions, 
particularly where things are bit convoluted, as well as style decisions or 
naming conventions.

## Interactive testing
- Most functions have an examples section in the roxygen2 docs which can be
  used for interactive testing.
- Most Shiny App functions have multiple settings for using pre-filled 
  spatial file paths, or simulating loading data, or a vanilla run.

## Data storage

Data used for preparing data sets for the package. 

- Smaller data to be accessed by the user are stored in `inst/extdata`. 
- Large data or data which should not be shared directly, are stored in the 
  `misc` folder which is Git-ignored. This ensures the same path for all developers
  and that data is kept within the project.
- However, for reasons, R CMD Build actually copies all files to a temp folder 
  and *then* deletes the ones in .Rbuildignore, which can create problems.
  The fix to this (if using RStudio) is to add `PKG_BUILD_COPY_METHOD=link` 
  to your .Renviron file, which will link to those files rather than copying.

## Workflow style

Workflows (i.e. not functions, but for example scripts to create internal data)
use sections (# Header -------) to create the TOC used in RStudio.

## Naming
- Snake case is used wherever possible
- Test files are named `test-XX_DESCRIPTION.R`, where `XX` is the order they 
  should be run (try to test lower order functions first).

## Documentation
- `aa_common_docs.R` holds documentation that is common to multiple functions.
  Use `@inheritParams` to pull out the documentation for function parameters 
  from the common docs. If you include your own documentation for that parameter
  it will take precedence.
  
## Shiny Modules

### Namespacing
Namespacing can be a bit tricky in modules. In the simplest way, you just need
to use the `NS()` function in the UI or the `ns` variable in the server (if
using `renderUI()`, not required for anything going to/from `output` or `input`)

- UI: Use `ns <- NS(id)` at the start, wrap all UI ids in `ns(my_id)`
- Server: Use `ns <- serssion$ns` at the start, then wrap ids in `ns(my_id)`. 

**Notes**

- We only need to use `ns(my_id)` in the server if creating our own UI elements
  i.e. with `renderUI()`
- In functions which dynamically create UIs, use `NS(id, ui_id)` *inside* the 
  function, cf `get_file_ui2()`
- `conditionalPanel()` has a `ns` argument we should use (https://stackoverflow.com/a/76905697)
- `NS()` (or `ns`) is *not* required for shinyjs
  - e.g., `spat_vuln_hide2()`

### Passing variables among modules
- We return reactives from a module like returning outputs from a function,
  put them in a list calling them by name (i.e. `spatial_data`,
  not`spatial_data()`)
- Then pass them as arguments to other module functions
- Remember that we want a list of reactives, not a reactive that returns a list
  (otherwise anytime any list item is updated, the whole reactive invalidates)

### Checking inputs and messages
- Cannot use shinyFeedback for shinyFiles inputs
- But can use validate(need()) on the *text outputs* to provide messages about file paths
- To ensure that the spatial files are loaded early and to catch specific messages
  related to each file, we use 'error' verbatim textboxes that pass through any
  validate(need()) failures.


## Notes
- 
- `spat_vuln_hide2()` gets no `req()` because depends on present/absence to hide

## Testing
- It makes testing easier if, as much as possible, all code is moved into 
  functions which can be tested individually, as well as used to create inputs
  for other parts of tests.
- `server_setup()` checks `is_testing()` to set the relative path correctly when running tests.
- Consider running `devtools::test(filter = "test-FILE")` to test a single
  file in a 'clean' session. Helps find out why getting warnings which are
  once per session, for example, without have to re-run the entire set of tests.

### testServer()
- Where possible, testing is performed with the `testServer()` (Rather than 
shinytest2) https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-testing.html#testing-reactivity
- See `?MockShinySession` for some of what you can access in the testServer
- Can't test input recovery from previous data because doesn't work with
  `update*()` family of functions (https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-testing.html#limitations)
- Can use `browser()` inside `testServer({...})` to interactively test and set
  up expectations.
- Errors implying that cannot find bottom of stack usually just mean that the
  snapshot has changed, so use `snapshot_review()`


### shinytest2
- see `?shinytest2::AppDriver` for some of what you can access form the `AppDriver`
- shinytest2 can be a bit finicky, but once you get the details right it works well
- **You MUST rebuild the package before running Shiny tests!**
- Errors in the test pane that imply the app is working (not that specific tests 
  are failing) are best troubleshooted by using `record_test()` (don't actually 
  record it, but the errors messages are much better in this mode, and may be 
  something as simple as misspelling a function name, for example)
- Because the app is running from a function, `record_test()` can be used to 
  create the details of the test, but not the whole test file (you need to copy
  the code and add it to an existing test). 
- shinyFiles is a pain to test (because it uses actionButtons, which shinytest2
  insists can only be 'clicked' not set to file values), so we don't test the
  actual loading directly.
- Clicking on modal buttons: https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest/issues/227
- comments about "shiny.testmode" being set are almost always red herrings and
  point out a general error in the app.
- If snapshots keep changing by a small amount, add a Sys.sleep(1) to force the
  test to wait until it's ready
