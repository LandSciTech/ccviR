Column Name,Definition
species_name,Scientific name of the species
common_name,Common name of the species
geo_location,Geographic area assessed
assessor,Name of the assessor
taxonomic_group,Taxonomic group of the species
migratory,Whether the species is migratory and exposure data for the migratory range that lies outside of the assessment area was provided
cave_grnd_water,Whether the species is an obligate of caves or groundwater systems
CCVI_index,Calculated CCVI index
CCVI_conf_index,Level of confidence in the CCVI index result. This is based on the proportion of Monte Carlo results that had different index values
mig_exposure,Index of migratory exposure
b_c_score,Total score from sections B and C the indirect exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity questions
d_score,Total score from section D the modelled response to climate change section
MC_freq_*,The proportion of Monte Carlo runs with each CCVI index result
MAT_#,The percentage of the species' range that is exposed to each class of change in mean annual temperature between the historical normal and predicted climate. Class 1 has the highest exposure and Class 6 the lowest
CMD_#,The percentage of the species' range that is exposed to each class of change in climate moisture deficit between the historical normal and predicted climate. Class 1 has the highest exposure and Class 6 the lowest
CCEI_#,The percentage of the species' non-breeding range that falls into each climate change exposure index class. Class 1 indicates high exposure while Class 4 indicates low exposure
perc_non_breed_not_over_ccei,The precentage of the non-breeding range that does not overlap with the CCEI raster data
HTN_#,The percentage of the species' range that is exposed to each class of variation between the historical coldest and warmest monts. Class 1 has the smallest variation and Class 4 is the largest
PTN,The percentage of the species' range that falls into cool or cold environments that may be lost or reduced in the assessment area as a result of climate change
MAP_max/min,The maximum and minimum historical mean annual precipitation in the species' range
range_change,The projected decrease in range size as a percentage of current range size. Negative numbers indicate an increase in range size
range_overlap,The percentage of the current range that is projected to remain in the future range.
range_size,The area of the species' range in m2

,"Answers to each question plus any comments. -1) No selection, 0) Neutral, 1) Somewhat increase, 2) Increase, 3) Greatly increase. If there are 2 numbers then two boxes were checked and the average of the scores was used in the total score"
