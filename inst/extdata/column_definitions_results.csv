MC_freq_*,The proportion of Monte Carlo runs with each CCVI index result
MAT_#,The percentage of the species' range that is exposed to each class of change in mean annual temperature between the historical normal and predicted climate. Class 1 has the highest exposure and Class 6 the lowest
CMD_#,The percentage of the species' range that is exposed to each class of change in climate moisture deficit between the historical normal and predicted climate. Class 1 has the highest exposure and Class 6 the lowest

HTN_#,The percentage of the species' range that is exposed to each class of variation between the historical coldest and warmest months. Class 1 has the smallest variation and Class 4 is the largest
PTN,The percentage of the species' range that falls into cool or cold environments that may be lost or reduced in the assessment area as a result of climate change
MAP_max/min,The maximum and minimum historical mean annual precipitation in the species' range
range_change,The projected decrease in range size as a percentage of current range size. Negative numbers indicate an increase in range size
range_overlap,The percentage of the current range that is projected to remain in the future range.
range_size,The area of the species' range in m2
protected,The percentage of the future range that overlaps protected areas.
gain_mod, Gain modifier. Used to down-weight modelled range gains
gain_mod_comm, Explaination for gain modifier choice

maint,"lower, upper bounds for raster values interpreted as range maintained under climate change"
gain,"lower, upper bounds for raster values interpreted as range gained under climate change"
ns,"lower, upper bounds for raster values interpreted as not suitable habitat at any point"
rng_chg_used,"Whether range change rasters showing projected future change in species range were used. Options are no, one, or multiple"
,
,"Answers to each question plus any comments. -1) No selection, 0) Neutral, 1) Somewhat increase, 2) Increase, 3) Greatly increase. If there are 2 numbers then two boxes were checked and the average of the scores was used in the total score"
