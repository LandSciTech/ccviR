\arguments{
\item{range_poly}{an sf polygon object giving the species range.}

\item{scale_poly}{an sf polygon object giving the area of the assessment}

\item{clim_vars_lst}{a list of climate data, the result of
\code{\link{get_clim_vars}}}

\item{non_breed_poly}{Optional. An sf polygon object giving the species range
in the non-breeding season.}

\item{ptn_poly}{Optional. An sf polygon object giving the locations that are
considered part of the physiological thermal niche (See NatureServe
Guidelines for definition).}

\item{hs_rast}{Optional. A SpatRaster object with results from a model of the
change in the species' range caused by climate change. To supply different
results for each scenario use a raster with multiple layers and ensure that the order of
the layers matches the order of \code{scenario_names}.}

\item{hs_rcl}{a matrix used to classify \code{hs_rast} into 0: not suitable, 1:
lost, 2: maintained, 3: gained. See \code{\link[terra]{classify}} for
details on the matrix format.}

\item{gain_mod}{a number between 0 and 1 that can be used to down-weight gains
in the modeled range change under climate change}

\item{scenario_names}{character vector with names that identify multiple
future climate scenarios.}
}
\value{
a list with elements: \code{spat_table} the results of the spatial
analysis, \code{range_poly_assess} the range polygon clipped to the
assessment area, and \code{range_poly_clim} the range polygon clipped to
the extent of the climate data.

\code{spat_table} contains the following columns:
\describe{
\item{scenario_name}{Name identifying the scenario}
\item{MAT_#}{The percentage of the species' range that is exposed to each class of change in mean annual temperature between the historical normal and predicted climate. Class 1 has the highest exposure and Class 6 the lowest}
\item{CMD_#}{The percentage of the species' range that is exposed to each class of change in climate moisture deficit between the historical normal and predicted climate. Class 1 has the highest exposure and Class 6 the lowest}
\item{CCEI_#}{The percentage of the species' non-breeding range that falls into each climate change exposure index class. Class 4 indicates high exposure while Class 1 indicates low exposure }
\item{perc_non_breed_not_over_ccei}{The precentage of the non-breeding range that does not overlap with the CCEI raster data}
\item{HTN_#}{The percentage of the species' range that is exposed to each class of variation between the historical coldest and warmest monts. Class 1 has the smallest variation and Class 4 is the largest}
\item{PTN}{The percentage of the species' range that falls into cool or cold environments that may be lost or reduced in the assessment area as a result of climate change}
\item{MAP_max/min}{The maximum and minimum historical mean annual precipitation in the species' range}
\item{range_change}{The projected decrease in range size as a percentage of current range size. Negative numbers indicate an increase in range size}
\item{range_overlap}{The percentage of the current range that is projected to remain in the future range.}
\item{range_size}{The area of the species' range in m2}
}
}
\description{
Run the required spatial analysis to create the \code{spat_df} input for
\code{\link{calc_vulnerability}} and clip the range polygon to the
appropriate scales.
}
\details{
The range polygon will be clipped to the area overlapping the
\code{scale_poly} and also to the area overlapping the extent of the
climate data polygon. The range within the assessment area is used to
calculate all results except the historical thermal and hydrological niches
for which the range within the extent of the climate data is used.
