\title{Calculate the vulnerability index score}
\usage{
calc_vulnerability(spat_df, vuln_df, tax_grp, n_rnds = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{spat_df}{data.frame of spatial inputs produced by \code{run_spatial}}

\item{vuln_df}{data.frame of answers to vulnerability questions. The format
must match \code{\link{make_vuln_df}}.}

\item{tax_grp}{taxonomic group of the species. Must match one of the options
below}

\item{n_rnds}{number of monte carlo repetitions for determining variability
when multiple values are given for a factor}
}
\value{
A list:
\describe{
  \item{index}{The index value as a string. EV: Extremely Vulnerable,
  HV: Highly Vulnerable, MV: Moderately Vulnerable, LV: Less Vulnerable,
  IE: Insufficient Evidence}
  \item{conf_index}{An index of the confidence in the index based on the
  monte carlo. Options are Low, Moderate, High, Very High or Insufficient Evidence.}
  \item{mc_results}{A data.frame with the b_c_score, d_score, and index for each monte carlo repitition}
  \item{mig_exp}{An index of the migratory exposure. Options are Low, Moderate, High, or "N/A"}
  \item{d_score}{Total score from section D the modelled response to climate change section}
  \item{b_c_score}{Total score from sections B and C the indirect exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity sections}
  \item{vuln_df}{Answers to each question plus any comments. Numerical scores correspond to:
   -1) Unknown, 0) Neutral, 1) Somewhat increase, 2) Increase, 3) Greatly increase.
   If there are 2 numbers then two boxes were checked and the average of the scores
   was used in the total score}
  \item{n_b_factors}{Number of factors scored in section B}
  \item{n_c_factors}{Number of factors scored in section C}
  \item{n_d_factors}{Number of factors scored in section D}
  \item{slr_vuln}{Whether the species' vulnerability to sea level rise and dispersal limitations led to an index of EV}
}
}

Invert-Insect, Invert-Mollusk, Invert-Other, Fish, Amphibian, Reptile,
Mammal, Bird
