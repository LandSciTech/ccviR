# ccviR: Calculate the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index in R

The ccviR package implements the NatureServe Climate Change
Vulnerability Index (CCVI) version 3.02
<https://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/climate-change-vulnerability-index>
in an R package and Shiny App. The package allows all of the geospatial
aspects of calculating the CCVI to be done in R, removing the need for
separate GIS calculations. It also enables easier sensitivity analysis
of the Index. The app provides an interactive application designed to
offer a user-friendly and simple interface for calculating the
NatureServe CCVI. See Young et. al (2012)

description of the index.
