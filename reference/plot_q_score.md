# Plot scores for each vulnerability question

A graph to help visualize what factors are influencing the index.
Produces a plotly graphic where the bars are the total score for the
factor after modifying it based on exposure. Hover to see the name of
the factor and value of the exposure multiplier. Facets are produced if
there are multiple scenarios

## Usage

``` r
plot_q_score(vuln_df, tax_grp = "Bird")
```

## Arguments

- vuln_df:

  the `vuln_df` element of the result from
  [`calc_vulnerability`](https://landscitech.github.io/ccviR/reference/calc_vulnerability.md)
  with an added column for the scenario_name. See examples.

- tax_grp:

  Taxonomic group

## Value

plotly graph
